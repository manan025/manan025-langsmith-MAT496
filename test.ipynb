Typically, there is one organization per company. An organization can have multiple workspaces. For more details, see the setup guide.\\nWhen you log in for the first time, a personal organization will be created for you automatically. If you’d like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join. There are a few important differences between your personal organization and shared organizations:\\nFeaturePersonalSharedMaximum workspaces1Variable, depending on plan (see pricing pageCollaborationCannot invite usersCan invite usersBilling: paid plansDeveloper plan onlyAll other plans available\\n\\u200bWorkspaces\\nWorkspaces were formerly called Tenants. Some code and APIs may still reference the old name for a period of time during the transition.\\nA workspace is a logical grouping of users and resources within an organization. A workspace separates trust boundaries for resources and access control. Users may have permissions in a workspace that grant them access to the resources in that workspace, including tracing projects, datasets, annotation queues, and prompts. For more details, see the setup guide.\\nIt is recommended to create a separate workspace for each team within your organization. To organize resources even further, you can use Resource Tags to group resources within a workspace.\\nThe following image shows a sample workspace settings page: \\nThe following diagram explains the relationship between organizations, workspaces, and the different resources scoped to and within a workspace: \\nSee the table below for details on which features are available in which scope (organization or workspace):\\nResource/SettingScopeTrace ProjectsWorkspaceAnnotation QueuesWorkspaceDeploymentsWorkspaceDatasets & ExperimentsWorkspacePromptsWorkspaceResource TagsWorkspaceAPI KeysWorkspaceSettings including Secrets, Feedback config, Models, Rules, and Shared URLsWorkspaceUser management: Invite User to WorkspaceWorkspaceRBAC: Assigning Workspace RolesWorkspaceData Retention, Usage LimitsWorkspace*Plans and Billing, Credits, InvoicesOrganizationUser management: Invite User to OrganizationOrganization**Adding WorkspacesOrganizationAssigning Organization RolesOrganizationRBAC: Creating/Editing/Deleting Custom RolesOrganization\\n* Data retention settings and usage limits will be available soon for the organization level as well ** Self-hosted installations may enable workspace-level invites of users to the organization via a feature flag. See the self-hosted user management docs for details.\\n\\u200bResource tags\\nResource tags allow you to organize resources within a workspaces. Each tag is a key-value pair that can be assigned to a resource. Tags can be used to filter workspace-scoped resources in the UI and API: Projects, Datasets, Annotation Queues, Deployments, and Experiments.\\nEach new workspace comes with two default tag keys: Application and Environment; as the names suggest, these tags can be used to categorize resources based on the application and environment they belong to. More tags can be added as needed.\\nLangSmith resource tags are very similar to tags in cloud services like AWS.\\n\\n\\u200bUser Management and RBAC\\n\\u200bUsers\\nA user is a person who has access to LangSmith. Users can be members of one or more organizations and workspaces within those organizations.\\nOrganization members are managed in organization settings:\\n\\nAnd workspace members are managed in workspace settings:\\n\\n\\u200bAPI keys\\nWe ended support for legacy API keys prefixed with ls__ on October 22, 2024 in favor of personal access tokens (PATs) and service keys. We require using PATs and service keys for all new integrations. API keys prefixed with ls__ will no longer work as of October 22, 2024.\\n\\u200bExpiration Dates\\nWhen you create an API key, you have the option to set an expiration date. Adding an expiration date keys enhances security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access. For example, you may set expiration dates on keys for temporary tasks that require elevated access.\\nBy default, keys never expire. Once expired, an API key is no longer valid and cannot be reactivated or have its expiration modified.\\n\\u200bPersonal Access Tokens (PATs)\\nPersonal Access Tokens (PATs) are used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API. They are created by users and scoped to a user. The PAT will have the same permissions as the user that created it. We recommend not using these to authenticate requests from your application, but rather using them for personal scripts or tools that interact with the LangSmith API. If the user associated with the PAT is removed from the organization, the PAT will no longer work.\\nPATs are prefixed with lsv2_pt_\\n\\u200bService keys\\nService keys are similar to PATs, but are used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API on behalf of a service account. Only admins can create service keys. We recommend using these for applications / services that need to interact with the LangSmith API, such as LangGraph agents or other integrations. Service keys may be scoped to a single workspace, multiple workspaces, or the entire organization, and can be used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API for whichever workspace(s) it has access to.\\nService keys are prefixed with lsv2_sk_\\nUse the X-Tenant-Id header to specify the target workspace.\\nWhen using PATs: If this header is omitted, requests will run against the default workspace associated with the key.\\nWhen using organization-scoped service keys: You must include the X-Tenant-Id header when accessing workspace-scoped resources. Without it, the request will fail with a 403 Forbidden error.\\n\\nTo see how to create a service key or Personal Access Token, see the setup guide\\n\\u200bOrganization roles\\nOrganization roles are distinct from the Enterprise feature (RBAC) below and are used in the context of multiple workspaces. Your organization role determines your workspace membership characteristics and your organization-level permissions. See the organization setup guide for more information.\\nThe organization role selected also impacts workspace membership as described here:\\n\\nOrganization Admin grants full access to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces. An Organization Admin has Admin access to all workspaces in an organization\\nOrganization User may read organization information but cannot execute any write actions at the organization level. An Organization User can be added to a subset of workspaces and assigned workspace roles as usual (if RBAC is enabled), which specify permissions at the workspace level.\\n\\nThe Organization User role is only available in organizations on plans with multiple workspaces. In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are Organization Admins. Custom organization-scoped roles are not available yet.\\nSee the table below for all organization permissions:\\nOrganization UserOrganization AdminView organization configuration✅✅View organization roles✅✅View organization members✅✅View data retention settings✅✅View usage limits✅✅Admin access to all workspaces✅Manage billing settings✅Create workspaces✅Create, edit, and delete organization roles✅Invite new users to organization✅Delete user invites✅Remove users from an organization✅Update data retention settings*✅Update usage limits*✅\\n\\u200bWorkspace roles (RBAC)\\nRBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a feature that is only available to Enterprise customers. If you are interested in this feature, contact our sales team. Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\\nRoles are used to define the set of permissions that a user has within a workspace. There are three built-in system roles that cannot be edited:\\n\\nAdmin - has full access to all resources within the workspace\\nViewer - has read-only access to all resources within the workspace\\nEditor - has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys)\\n\\nOrganization admins can also create/edit custom roles with specific permissions for different resources.\\nRoles can be managed in organization settings under the Roles tab:\\n\\nFor more details on assigning and creating roles, see the access control setup guide.\\n\\u200bBest Practices\\n\\u200bEnvironment Separation\\nUse resource tags to organize resources by environment using the default tag key Environment and different values for the environment (e.g. dev, staging, prod). This tagging structure will allow you to organize your tracing projects today and easily enforce permissions when we release attribute based access control (ABAC). ABAC on the resource tag will provide a fine-grained way to restrict access to production tracing projects, for example. We do not recommend that you use Workspaces for environment separation as you cannot share resources across Workspaces. If you would like to promote a prompt from staging to prod, we recommend you use commit tags instead. See docs for more information.\\n\\u200bUsage and Billing\\n\\u200bData Retention\\nIn May 2024, LangSmith introduced a maximum data retention period on traces of 400 days. In June 2024, LangSmith introduced a new data retention based pricing model where customers can configure a shorter data retention period on traces in exchange for savings up to 10x. On this page, we’ll go through how data retention works and is priced in LangSmith.\\n\\u200bWhy retention matters\\n\\nPrivacy: Many data privacy regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, require organizations to delete personal data once it’s no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Setting retention periods aids in compliance with such regulations.\\nCost: LangSmith charges less for traces that have low data retention. See our tutorial on how to optimize spend for details.\\n\\n\\u200bHow it works\\nLangSmith now has two tiers of traces based on Data Retention with the following characteristics:\\nBaseExtendedPrice$.50 / 1k traces$5 / 1k tracesRetention Period14 days400 days\\nData deletion after retention ends\\nAfter the specified retention period, traces are no longer accessible via the runs table or API. All user data associated with the trace (e.g. inputs and outputs) is deleted from our internal systems within a day thereafter. Some metadata associated with each trace may be retained indefinitely for analytics and billing purposes.\\nData retention auto-upgrades\\nAuto upgrades can have an impact on your bill. Please read this section carefully to fully understand your estimated LangSmith tracing costs.\\nWhen you use certain features with base tier traces, their data retention will be automatically upgraded to extended tier. This will increase both the retention period, and the cost of the trace.\\nThe complete list of scenarios in which a trace will upgrade when:\\n\\nFeedback is added to any run on the trace\\nAn Annotation Queue receives any run from the trace\\nA Run Rule matches any run within a trace\\n\\nWhy auto-upgrade traces?\\nWe have two reasons behind the auto-upgrade model for tracing:\\n\\nWe think that traces that match any of these conditions are fundamentally more interesting than other traces, and therefore it is good for users to be able to keep them around longer.\\nWe philosophically want to charge customers an order of magnitude lower for traces that may not be interacted with meaningfully. We think auto-upgrades align our pricing model with the value that LangSmith brings, where only traces with meaningful interaction are charged at a higher rate.\\n\\nIf you have questions or concerns about our pricing model, please feel free to reach out to support@langchain.dev and let us know your thoughts!\\nHow does data retention affect downstream features?\\n\\nAnnotation Queues, Run Rules, and Feedback: Traces that use these features will be auto-upgraded.\\nMonitoring: The monitoring tab will continue to work even after a base tier trace’s data retention period ends. It is powered by trace metadata that exists for >30 days, meaning that your monitoring graphs will continue to stay accurate even on base tier traces.\\nDatasets: Datasets have an indefinite data retention period. Restated differently, if you add a trace’s inputs and outputs to a dataset, they will never be deleted. We suggest that if you are using LangSmith for data collection, you take advantage of the datasets feature.\\n\\n\\u200bBilling model\\nBillable metrics\\nOn your LangSmith invoice, you will see two metrics that we charge for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge)\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades).\\n\\nThe first metric includes all traces, regardless of tier. The second metric just counts the number of extended retention traces.\\nWhy measure all traces + upgrades instead of base and extended traces?\\nA natural question to ask when considering our pricing is why not just show the number of base tier and extended tier traces directly on the invoice?\\nWhile we understand this would be more straightforward, it doesn’t fit trace upgrades properly. Consider a base tier trace that was recorded on June 30, and upgraded to extended tier on July 3. The base tier trace occurred in the June billing period, but the upgrade occurred in the July billing period. Therefore, we need to be able to measure these two events independently to properly bill our customers.\\nIf your trace was recorded as an extended retention trace, then the base and extended metrics will both be recorded with the same timestamp.\\nCost breakdown\\nThe Base Charge for a trace is .05¢ per trace. We priced the upgrade such that an extended retention trace costs 10x the price of a base tier trace (.50¢ per trace) including both metrics. Thus, each upgrade costs .45¢.\\n\\u200bRate Limits\\nLangSmith has rate limits which are designed to ensure the stability of the service for all users.\\nTo ensure access and stability, LangSmith will respond with HTTP Status Code 429 indicating that rate or usage limits have been exceeded under the following circumstances:\\n\\u200bScenarios\\nTemporary throughput limit over a 1 minute period at our application load balancer\\nThis 429 is the the result of exceeding a fixed number of API calls over a 1 minute window on a per API key/access token basis. The start of the window will vary slightly — it is not guaranteed to start at the start of a clock minute — and may change depending on application deployment events.\\nAfter the max events are received we will respond with a 429 until 60 seconds from the start of the evaluation window has been reached and then the process repeats.\\nThis 429 is thrown by our application load balancer and is a mechanism in place for all LangSmith users independent of plan tier to ensure continuity of service for all users.\\nMethodEndpointLimitWindowDELETESessions301 minutePOST OR PATCHRuns50001 minutePOSTFeedback50001 minute**20001 minute\\nThe LangSmith SDK takes steps to minimize the likelihood of reaching these limits on run-related endpoints by batching up to 100 runs from a single session ID into a single API call.\\nPlan-level hourly trace event limit\\nThis 429 is the result of reaching your maximum hourly events ingested and is evaluated in a fixed window starting at the beginning of each clock hour in UTC and resets at the top of each new hour.\\nAn event in this context is the creation or update of a run. So if run is created, then subsequently updated in the same hourly window, that will count as 2 events against this limit.\\nThis is thrown by our application and varies by plan tier, with organizations on our Startup/Plus and Enterprise plan tiers having higher hourly limits than our Free and Developer Plan Tiers which are designed for personal use.\\nPlanLimitWindowDeveloper (no payment on file)50,000 events1 hourDeveloper (with payment on file)250,000 events1 hourStartup/Plus500,000 events1 hourEnterpriseCustomCustom\\nPlan-level hourly trace data ingest limit\\nThis 429 is the result of reaching the maximum amount of data ingested across your trace inputs, outputs, and metadata and is evaluated in a fixed window starting at the beginning of each clock hour in UTC and resets at the top of each new hour.\\nTypically, inputs, outputs, and metadata are send on both run creation and update events. So if a run is created and is 2.0MB in size at creation, and 3.0MB in size when updated in the same hourly window, that will count as 5.0MB of storage against this limit.\\nThis is thrown by our application and varies by plan tier, with organizations on our Startup/Plus and Enterprise plan tiers having higher hourly limits than our Free and Developer Plan Tiers which are designed for personal use.\\nPlanLimitWindowDeveloper (no payment on file)500MB1 hourDeveloper (with payment on file)2.5GB1 hourStartup/Plus5.0GB1 hourEnterpriseCustomCustom\\nPlan-level monthly unique traces limit\\nThis 429 is the result of reaching your maximum monthly traces ingested and is evaluated in a fixed window starting at the beginning of each calendar month in UTC and resets at the beginning of each new month.\\nThis is thrown by our application and applies only to the Developer Plan Tier when there is no payment method on file.\\nPlanLimitWindowDeveloper (no payment on file)5,000 traces1 month\\nSelf-configured monthly usage limits\\nThis 429 is the result of reaching your usage limit as configured by your organization admin and is evaluated in a fixed window starting at the beginning of each calendar month in UTC and resets at the beginning of each new month.\\nThis is thrown by our application and varies by organization based on their configured settings.\\n\\u200bHandling 429s responses in your application\\nSince some 429 responses are temporary and may succeed on a successive call, if you are directly calling the LangSmith API in your application we recommend implementing retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter.\\nFor convenience, LangChain applications built with the LangSmith SDK has this capability built-in.\\nIt is important to note that if you are saturating the endpoints for extended periods of time, retries may not be effective as your application will eventually run large enough backlogs to exhaust all retries.If that is the case, we would like to discuss your needs more specifically. Please reach out to LangSmith Support with details about your applications throughput needs and sample code and we can work with you to better understand whether the best approach is fixing a bug, changes to your application code, or a different LangSmith plan.\\n\\u200bUsage Limits\\nLangSmith lets you configure usage limits on tracing. Note that these are usage limits, not spend limits, which mean they let you limit the quantity of occurrences of some event rather than the total amount you will spend.\\nLangSmith lets you set two different monthly limits, mirroring our Billable Metrics discussed in the aforementioned data retention guide:\\n\\nAll traces limit\\nExtended data retention traces limit\\n\\nThese let you limit the number of total traces, and extended data retention traces respectively.\\n\\u200bProperties of usage limiting\\nUsage limiting is approximate, meaning that we do not guarantee the exactness of the limit. In rare cases, there may be a small period of time where additional traces are processed above the limit threshold before usage limiting begins to apply.\\n\\u200bSide effects of extended data retention traces limit\\nThe extended data retention traces limit has side effects. If the limit is already reached, any feature that could cause an auto-upgrade of tracing tiers becomes inaccessible. This is because an auto-upgrade of a trace would cause another extended retention trace to be created, which in turn should not be allowed by the limit. Therefore, you can no longer:\\n\\nmatch run rules\\nadd feedback to traces\\nadd runs to annotation queues\\n\\nEach of these features may cause an auto upgrade, so we shut them off when the limit is reached.\\n\\u200bUpdating usage limits\\nUsage limits can be updated from the Settings page under Usage and Billing. Limit values are cached, so it may take a minute or two before the new limits apply.\\n\\u200bRelated content\\n\\nTutorial on how to optimize spend\\n\\n\\u200bAdditional Resources\\n\\nRelease Versions: Learn about LangSmith’s version support policy, including Active, Critical, End of Life, and Deprecated support levels.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsCreate an account and API key⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you’d like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.\\nTo do this, open the Organizations drawer by clicking your profile icon in the bottom left and click + New. Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to set up billing to proceed.\\n\\u200bManage and navigate workspaces\\nOnce you’ve subscribed to a plan that allows for multiple users per organization, you can set up workspaces to collaborate more effectively and isolate LangSmith resources between different groups of users. To navigate between workspaces and access the resources within each workspace (trace projects, annotation queues, etc.), select the desired workspace from the picker in the top left:\\n\\n\\u200bManage users\\nManage membership in your shared organization in the Members and roles tabs on the Settings page. Here you can:\\n\\nInvite new users to your organization, selecting workspace membership and (if RBAC is enabled) workspace role.\\nEdit a user’s organization role.\\nRemove users from your organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganizations on the Enterprise plan may set up custom workspace roles in the Roles tab. For more details, refer to the access control setup guide.\\n\\u200bOrganization roles\\nOrganization-scoped roles are used to determine access to organization settings. The role selected also impacts workspace membership:\\n\\nOrganization Admin grants full access to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces. Any Organization Admin has Admin access to all workspaces in an organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganization User may read organization information, but cannot execute any write actions at the organization level. You can add an Organization User to a subset of workspaces and assigned workspace roles as usual (if RBAC is enabled), which specify permissions at the workspace level.\\n\\nThe Organization User role is only available in organizations on plans with multiple workspaces. In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are Organization Admins. Custom organization-scoped roles are not available.\\nFor a full list of permissions associated with each role, refer to the Administration overview page.\\n\\u200bSet up a workspace\\nWhen you log in for the first time, a default workspace will be created for you in your personal organization. Workspaces are often used to separate resources between different teams or business units to establish clear trust boundaries between them. Within each workspace, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manages permissions and access levels, which ensures that users only have access to the resources and settings necessary for their role. Most LangSmith activity happens in the context of a workspace, each of which has its own settings and access controls.\\nTo organize resources within a workspace, you can use resource tags.\\n\\u200bCreate a workspace\\nTo create a new workspace, navigate to the Settings page Workspaces tab in your shared organization and click Add Workspace. Once you have created your workspace, you can manage its members and other configuration by selecting it on this page.\\n\\nDifferent plans have different limits placed on the number of workspaces that can be used in an organization. For more information, refer to the pricing page.\\n\\u200bManage users\\nOnly workspace Admins can manage workspace membership and, if RBAC is enabled, change a user’s workspace role.\\nFor users that are already members of an organization, a workspace Admin may add them to a workspace in the Workspace members tab under Workspaces settings page. Users may also be invited directly to one or more workspaces when they are invited to an organization.\\n\\u200bConfigure workspace settings\\nWorkspace configuration exists in the Workspaces settings page tab. Select the workspace to configure and then the desired configuration sub-tab. The following example shows the API keys, and other configuration options including secrets, models, and shared URLs are available here as well.\\n\\n\\u200bDelete a workspace\\nDeleting a workspace will permanently delete the workspace and all associated data.

You can sign up for a free account here. We support logging in with Google, GitHub, and email.\\n\\n\\u200bAPI keys\\nLangSmith supports two types of API keys: Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens. Both types of tokens can be used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API, but they have different use cases.\\nRead more about the differences between Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens under admin concepts\\n\\u200bCreate an API key\\nTo log traces and run evaluations with LangSmith, you will need to create an API key to authenticate your requests. API keys can be scoped to a set of workspaces, or the entire organization.\\nTo create either type of API key head to the Settings page, then scroll to the API Keys section. For service keys, choose between an organization-scoped and workspace-scoped key. If the key is workspace-scoped, the workspaces must then be specified. Enterprise users are also able to assign specific roles to the key, which adjusts its permissions. Set the key’s expiration; the key will become unusable after the number of days chosen, or never, if that is selected. Then click Create API Key.\\nThe API key will be shown only once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure the SDK\\nYou may set the following environment variables in addition to LANGSMITH_API_KEY.\\nThis is only required if using the EU instance.\\nLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com\\nThis is only required for keys scoped to more than one workspace.\\nLANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=<Workspace ID>\\n\\u200bUsing API keys outside of the SDK\\nSee instructions for managing your organization via API.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewSet up a workspace⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Data retention policies can be configured at the organization and project levels.\\nFor detailed information about data retention configuration and management, please refer to the Data Retention concepts documentation.\\nTrace Deletes\\u200b\\nYou can use the API to complete trace deletes. The API supports two methods for deleting traces:\\n\\nBy trace IDs and session ID: Delete specific traces by providing a list of trace IDs and their corresponding session ID (up to 1000 traces per request)\\nBy metadata: Delete traces across a workspace that match any of the specified metadata key-value pairs\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the API spec.\\nTrace DeletesAll trace deletions will delete related entities like feedbacks, aggregations, and stats across all data storages.\\nDeletion Timeline\\u200b\\nTrace deletions are processed during non-peak usage times and are not instant, usually within a few hours. There is no confirmation of deletion - you\\'ll need to query the data again to verify it has been removed.\\nDelete Specific Traces\\u200b\\nTo delete specific traces by their trace IDs from a single session:\\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/runs/delete\" \\\\  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\\  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\  -d \\'{    \"run_ids\": [\"trace-id-1\", \"trace-id-2\", \"trace-id-3\"],    \"session_id\": \"session-id-1\"  }\\'\\nDelete by Metadata\\u200b\\nWhen deleting by metadata:\\n\\nAccepts a metadata object of key/value pairs. KV pair matching uses an or condition. A trace will match if it has any of the key-value pairs specified in metadata (not all)\\nYou don\\'t need to specify a session id when deleting by metadata. Deletes will apply across the workspace.\\n\\nTo delete traces based on metadata across a workspace (matches any of the metadata key-value pairs):\\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/runs/delete\" \\\\  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\\  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\  -d \\'{    \"metadata\": {      \"user_id\": \"user123\",      \"environment\": \"staging\"    }  }\\'\\nThis will delete traces that have either user_id: \"user123\" or environment: \"staging\" in their metadata.\\nRate LimitsRemember that you can only schedule up to 1000 traces per session per request. For larger deletions, you\\'ll need to make multiple requests.\\nExample Deletes\\u200b\\nYou can delete dataset examples self-serve via our API, which supports both soft and hard deletion methods depending on your data retention needs.\\nExample DeletesHard deletes will permanently remove inputs, outputs, and metadata from ALL versions of the specified examples across the entire dataset history.\\nDeleting Examples is a Two-Step Process\\u200b\\nFor bulk operations, example deletion follows a two-step process:\\n1. Search for Examples by Metadata\\u200b\\nFind all examples with matching metadata across all datasets in a workspace.\\nGET /examples\\n\\nas_of must be explicitly specified as a timestamp. Only examples created before the as_of date will be returned\\n\\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/examples?as_of=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\" \\\\  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\\  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\  -d \\'{    \"metadata\": {      \"user_id\": \"user123\",      \"environment\": \"staging\"    }  }\\'\\nThis will return examples that have either user_id: \"user123\" or environment: \"staging\" in their metadata across all datasets in your workspace.\\n2. Hard Delete Examples\\u200b\\nOnce you have the example IDs, send a delete request. This will zero-out the inputs, outputs, and metadata from all versions of the dataset for that example.\\nDELETE /examples\\n\\nSpecify example IDs and add \"hard_delete\": true to the query params of the request\\n\\ncurl -X DELETE \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/examples?hard_delete=true\" \\\\  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\\  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\  -d \\'{    \"example_ids\": [\"example-id-1\", \"example-id-2\", \"example-id-3\"]  }\\'\\nDeletion Types\\u200b\\nSoft Delete (Default)\\u200b\\n\\nCreates tombstoned entries with NULL inputs/outputs in the dataset\\nPreserves historical data and maintains dataset versioning\\nOnly affects the current version of the dataset\\n\\nHard Delete\\u200b\\n\\nPermanently removes inputs, outputs, and metadata from ALL dataset versions\\nComplete data removal when compliance requires zero-out across all versions\\nAdd \"hard_delete\": true to the query parameters\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the API spec.Was this page helpful?You can leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousUpdate invoice email, tax id and, business informationNextManage your organization using the APIData RetentionTrace DeletesDeletion TimelineDelete Specific TracesDelete by MetadataExample DeletesDeleting Examples is a Two-Step ProcessDeletion TypesCommunityLangChain ForumTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogLangChain Python DocsLangChain JS/TS DocsCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n'),\n",

If you are interested in this feature, contact our sales team. Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\\nYou may find it helpful to read the Administration overview page before setting up access control.\\nLangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions within a workspace. This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the workspace:manage permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.\\n\\u200bCreate a role\\nBy default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:\\n\\nAdmin: has full access to all resources within the workspace.\\nViewer: has read-only access to all resources within the workspace.\\nEditor: has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys).\\n\\nIf these do not fit your access model, Organization Admins can create custom roles to suit your needs.\\nTo create a role, navigate to the Roles tab in the Members and roles section of the Organization settings page. Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.\\nClick on the Create Role button to create a new role. A Create role form will open.\\n\\nAssign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.\\n\\u200bAssign a role to a user\\nOnce you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the Workspace members tab in the Workspaces section of the Organization settings page\\nEach user will have a Role dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.\\n\\nYou can also invite new users with a given role.\\n\\n\\u200bSet up SAML SSO for your organization\\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise Cloud customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.\\nLangSmith’s SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.\\nSSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. The benefits of SSO include:\\n\\nStreamlines user management across systems for organization owners.\\nEnables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g., MFA).\\nRemoves the need for end users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies the end-user experience, by allowing sign in at one single access point across multiple applications.\\n\\n\\u200bJust-in-time (JIT) provisioning\\nLangSmith supports Just-in-time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.\\nJIT provisioning only runs for new users, that is, users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a different login method.\\n\\u200bLogin methods and access\\nOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other login methods, such as username/password or Google Authentication”:\\n\\nWhen logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.\\nUsers with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have personal organizations.\\nWhen logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of.\\n\\n\\u200bEnforce SAML SSO only\\nTo ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the Login via SSO only checkbox and click Save. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking Save.\\nYou must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to Only SAML SSO. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs. If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, reach out to the LangChain support team at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nSAML SSO is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Please contact sales to learn more.\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SAML SSO.\\n\\nFor instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning, refer to the SCIM setup.\\n\\u200bInitial configuration\\nFor IdP-specific configuration steps, refer to one of the following:\\nEntra ID\\nGoogle\\nOkta\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3.\\nThe following URLs are different for the US and EU regions. Ensure you select the correct link.\\n\\nSingle sign-on URL (or ACS URL):\\n\\nUS: https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs\\nEU: https://eu.auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs\\n\\n\\nAudience URI (or SP Entity ID):\\n\\nUS: https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata\\nEU: https://eu.auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata\\n\\n\\nName ID format: email address.\\nApplication username: email address.\\nRequired claims: sub and email.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn LangSmith: Go to Settings -> Members and roles -> SSO Configuration. Fill in the required information and submit to activate SSO login:\\n\\nFill in either the SAML metadata URL or SAML metadata XML.\\nSelect the Default workspace role and Default workspaces. New users logging in via SSO will be added to the specified workspaces with the selected role.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefault workspace role and Default workspaces are editable.

You can find this in the LangSmith UI under Organization members and roles then SSO configuration.\\n\\u200bSet up SCIM for your organization\\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and de-provision users in your LangSmith organization and workspaces, keeping user access synchronized with your organization’s identity provider.\\nSCIM is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Contact sales to learn more.SCIM is available on Helm chart versions 0.10.41 (application version 0.10.108) and later.SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).\\nSCIM eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization’s identity system. This allows for:\\n\\nAutomated user management: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP.\\nReduced administrative overhead: No need to manage user access manually across multiple systems.\\nImproved security: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith.\\nConsistent access control: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems.\\nScaling team access control: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles.\\nRole assignment: Select specific Organization Roles and Workspace Roles for groups of users.\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SCIM.\\nFor cloud customers: SAML SSO must be configurable for your organization.\\nFor self-hosted customers: OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode must be enabled.\\nFor self-hosted customers, network traffic must be allowed from the identity provider to LangSmith:\\n\\nMicrosoft Entra ID supports allowlisting IP ranges or an agent-based solution to provide connectivity.\\n(details).\\nOkta supports allow-listing IPs or domains (details)\\nor an agent-based solution (details) to provide connectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bRole Precedence\\nWhen a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:\\n\\nOrganization Admin groups take highest precedence. Users in these groups will be Admin in all workspaces.\\nMost recently created workspace-specific group takes precedence over other workspace groups.\\n\\nWhen a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules.SCIM group membership will override manually assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.\\n\\u200bEmail verification\\nIn cloud only, creating a new user with SCIM triggers an email to the user.\\nThey must verify their email address by clicking the link in this email.\\nThe link expires in 24 hours, and can be resent if needed by removing and re-adding the user via SCIM.\\n\\u200bAttributes and Mapping\\n\\u200bGroup Naming Convention\\nGroup membership maps to LangSmith workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:\\nOrganization Admin Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix>Organization Admin or <optional_prefix>Organization Admins\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization Admins\\nGroups-Organization Admins\\nOrganization Admin\\n\\nWorkspace-Specific Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix><org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization User:Production:Annotators\\nGroups-Organization User:Engineering:Developers\\nOrganization User:Marketing:Viewers\\n\\n\\u200bMapping\\nWhile specific instructions depending on the identity provider may vary, these mappings show what is supported by the LangSmith SCIM integration:\\n\\u200bUser Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserName1email addressactive!deactivatedemails[type eq \"work\"].valueemail address2name.formatteddisplayName OR givenName + familyName3givenNamegivenNamefamilyNamefamilyNameexternalIdsub41\\n\\nuserName is not required by LangSmith\\nEmail address is required\\nUse the computed expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion for cloud customers, or the sub OAuth2.0 claim for self-hosted.\\n\\n\\u200bGroup Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description identity provider attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\n\\u200bStep 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)\\nThere are two scenarios for SAML SSO configuration:\\n\\nIf SAML SSO is already configured for your organization, you should skip the steps to initially add the application (Add application from Okta Integration Network or Create a new Entra ID application integration), as you already have an application configured and just need to enable provisioning.\\nIf you are configuring SAML SSO for the first time alongside SCIM, first follow the instructions to set up SAML SSO, then follow the instructions here to enable SCIM.\\n\\n\\u200bNameID Format\\nLangSmith uses the SAML NameID to identify users. The NameID is a required field in the SAML response and is case-insensitive.\\nThe NameID must:\\n\\nBe unique to each user.\\nBe a persistent value that never changes, such as a randomly generated unique user ID.\\nMatch exactly on each sign-in attempt. It should not rely on user input.\\n\\nThe NameID should not be an email address or username because email addresses and usernames are more likely to change over time and can be case-sensitive.\\nThe NameID format must be Persistent, unless you are using a field, like email, that requires a different format.\\n\\u200bStep 2: Disable JIT provisioning\\nBefore enabling SCIM, disable Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning.\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Cloud\\nUse the PATCH /orgs/current/info endpoint:\\nCopycurl -X PATCH $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/orgs/current/info \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"jit_provisioning_enabled\": false}\\'\\n\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Self-Hosted\\nAs of LangSmith chart version 0.11.14, you can disable JIT provisioning for your self-hosted organization using SSO. To disable, set the following values:\\nCopycommonEnv:\\n  - name: SELF_HOSTED_JIT_PROVISIONING_ENABLED\\n    value: \"false\"\\n\\n\\u200bStep 3: Generate SCIM bearer token\\nIn self-hosted environments, the full URL below may look like https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (without a subdomain, note the /api/v1 path prefix) or https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/subdomain/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (with a subdomain) - see the ingress docs for more details.\\nGenerate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests. Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:\\nCopycurl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"description\": \"Your description here\"}\\'\\n\\nNote that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request. These additional endpoints are present:\\n\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\nPATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id} (only the description field is supported)\\nDELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\n\\n\\u200bStep 4: Configure your Identity Provider\\nIf you use Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) or Okta, there are specific instructions for identity provider setup (refer to Azure Entra ID, Okta). The requirements and steps above are applicable for all identity providers.\\n\\u200bAzure Entra ID configuration steps\\nFor additional information, see Microsoft’s documentation.\\nIn self-hosted installations, the oid JWT claim is used as the sub.\\nSee this Microsoft Learn link\\nand the related configuration instructions for additional details.\\nStep 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application\\n\\nLog in to the Azure portal with a privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator).\\nNavigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nIn the left-side navigation, select Manage > Provisioning.\\nClick Get started.\\n\\nStep 2: Configure Admin credentials\\n\\n\\nUnder Admin Credentials:\\n\\n\\nTenant URL:\\n\\nUS: https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nEU: https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nSelf-hosted: <langsmith_url>/scim/v2\\n\\n\\n\\nSecret Token: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick Test Connection to verify the configuration.\\n\\n\\nClick Save.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Configure Attribute Mappings\\nConfigure the following attribute mappings under Mappings:\\nUser Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserNameuserPrincipalNameactiveNot([IsSoftDeleted])emails[type eq \"work\"].valuemail1name.formatteddisplayName OR Join(\" \", [givenName], [surname])2externalIdobjectId31\\n\\nUser’s email address must be present in Entra ID.\\nUse the Join expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname.\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion and the sub OAuth2.0 claim. For SAML SSO in cloud, the Unique User Identifier (Name ID) required claim should be user.objectID and the Name identifier format should be persistent.\\n\\nGroup Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update only (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description Microsoft Entra ID Attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\nStep 4: Assign Users and Groups\\n\\nUnder Applications > Applications, select your LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nUnder the Assignments tab, click Assign then either Assign to People or Assign to Groups.\\nMake the desired selection(s), then Assign and Done.\\n\\nStep 5: Enable Provisioning\\n\\nSet Provisioning Status to On under Provisioning.\\nMonitor the initial sync to ensure users and groups are provisioned correctly.\\nOnce verified, enable Delete actions for both User and Group mappings.\\n\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs.

If you’d like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.\\nTo do this, open the Organizations drawer by clicking your profile icon in the bottom left and click + New. Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to set up billing to proceed.\\n\\u200bManage and navigate workspaces\\nOnce you’ve subscribed to a plan that allows for multiple users per organization, you can set up workspaces to collaborate more effectively and isolate LangSmith resources between different groups of users. To navigate between workspaces and access the resources within each workspace (trace projects, annotation queues, etc.), select the desired workspace from the picker in the top left:\\n\\n\\u200bManage users\\nManage membership in your shared organization in the Members and roles tabs on the Settings page. Here you can:\\n\\nInvite new users to your organization, selecting workspace membership and (if RBAC is enabled) workspace role.\\nEdit a user’s organization role.\\nRemove users from your organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganizations on the Enterprise plan may set up custom workspace roles in the Roles tab. For more details, refer to the access control setup guide.\\n\\u200bOrganization roles\\nOrganization-scoped roles are used to determine access to organization settings. The role selected also impacts workspace membership:\\n\\nOrganization Admin grants full access to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces. Any Organization Admin has Admin access to all workspaces in an organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganization User may read organization information, but cannot execute any write actions at the organization level. You can add an Organization User to a subset of workspaces and assigned workspace roles as usual (if RBAC is enabled), which specify permissions at the workspace level.\\n\\nThe Organization User role is only available in organizations on plans with multiple workspaces. In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are Organization Admins. Custom organization-scoped roles are not available.\\nFor a full list of permissions associated with each role, refer to the Administration overview page.\\n\\u200bSet up a workspace\\nWhen you log in for the first time, a default workspace will be created for you in your personal organization. Workspaces are often used to separate resources between different teams or business units to establish clear trust boundaries between them. Within each workspace, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manages permissions and access levels, which ensures that users only have access to the resources and settings necessary for their role. Most LangSmith activity happens in the context of a workspace, each of which has its own settings and access controls.\\nTo organize resources within a workspace, you can use resource tags.\\n\\u200bCreate a workspace\\nTo create a new workspace, navigate to the Settings page Workspaces tab in your shared organization and click Add Workspace. Once you have created your workspace, you can manage its members and other configuration by selecting it on this page.\\n\\nDifferent plans have different limits placed on the number of workspaces that can be used in an organization. For more information, refer to the pricing page.\\n\\u200bManage users\\nOnly workspace Admins can manage workspace membership and, if RBAC is enabled, change a user’s workspace role.\\nFor users that are already members of an organization, a workspace Admin may add them to a workspace in the Workspace members tab under Workspaces settings page. Users may also be invited directly to one or more workspaces when they are invited to an organization.\\n\\u200bConfigure workspace settings\\nWorkspace configuration exists in the Workspaces settings page tab. Select the workspace to configure and then the desired configuration sub-tab. The following example shows the API keys, and other configuration options including secrets, models, and shared URLs are available here as well.\\n\\n\\u200bDelete a workspace\\nDeleting a workspace will permanently delete the workspace and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.\\nYou can delete a workspace through the LangSmith UI or via API. You must be a workspace Admin in order to delete a workspace.\\n\\u200bDelete a workspace via the UI\\n\\nNavigate to Settings.\\nSelect the workspace you want to delete.\\nClick Delete in the top-right corner of the screen.\\n\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsCreate an account and API keyManage organizations using the API⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Tags are key-value pairs that you can attach to resources.\\n\\u200bCreate a tag\\nTo create a tag, head to the workspace settings and click on the “Resource Tags” tab. Here, you’ll be able to see the existing tag values, grouped by key. Two keys Application and Environment are created by default.\\nTo create a new tag, click on the “New Tag” button. You’ll be prompted to enter a key and a value for the tag. Note that you can use an existing key or create a new one.\\n\\n\\u200bAssign a tag to a resource\\nWithin the same side panel for creating a new tag, you can also create assign resources to tags. Search for corresponding resources in the “Assign Resources” section and select the resources you want to tag.\\nYou can only tag workspace-scoped resources with resource tags. This includes Tracing Projects, Annotation Queues, Deployments, Experiments, Datasets, and Prompts.\\nYou can also assign tags to resources from the resource’s detail page.

If you are interested in this feature, contact our sales team. Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\\nYou may find it helpful to read the Administration overview page before setting up access control.\\nLangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions within a workspace. This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the workspace:manage permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.\\n\\u200bCreate a role\\nBy default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:\\n\\nAdmin: has full access to all resources within the workspace.\\nViewer: has read-only access to all resources within the workspace.\\nEditor: has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys).\\n\\nIf these do not fit your access model, Organization Admins can create custom roles to suit your needs.\\nTo create a role, navigate to the Roles tab in the Members and roles section of the Organization settings page. Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.\\nClick on the Create Role button to create a new role. A Create role form will open.\\n\\nAssign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.\\n\\u200bAssign a role to a user\\nOnce you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the Workspace members tab in the Workspaces section of the Organization settings page\\nEach user will have a Role dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.\\n\\nYou can also invite new users with a given role.\\n\\n\\u200bSet up SAML SSO for your organization\\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise Cloud customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.\\nLangSmith’s SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.\\nSSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. The benefits of SSO include:\\n\\nStreamlines user management across systems for organization owners.\\nEnables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g., MFA).\\nRemoves the need for end users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies the end-user experience, by allowing sign in at one single access point across multiple applications.\\n\\n\\u200bJust-in-time (JIT) provisioning\\nLangSmith supports Just-in-time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.\\nJIT provisioning only runs for new users, that is, users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a different login method.\\n\\u200bLogin methods and access\\nOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other login methods, such as username/password or Google Authentication”:\\n\\nWhen logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.\\nUsers with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have personal organizations.\\nWhen logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of.\\n\\n\\u200bEnforce SAML SSO only\\nTo ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the Login via SSO only checkbox and click Save. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking Save.\\nYou must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to Only SAML SSO. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs. If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, reach out to the LangChain support team at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nSAML SSO is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Please contact sales to learn more.\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SAML SSO.\\n\\nFor instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning, refer to the SCIM setup.\\n\\u200bInitial configuration\\nFor IdP-specific configuration steps, refer to one of the following:\\nEntra ID\\nGoogle\\nOkta\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3.\\nThe following URLs are different for the US and EU regions.

You can find this in the LangSmith UI under Organization members and roles then SSO configuration.\\n\\u200bSet up SCIM for your organization\\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and de-provision users in your LangSmith organization and workspaces, keeping user access synchronized with your organization’s identity provider.\\nSCIM is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Contact sales to learn more.SCIM is available on Helm chart versions 0.10.41 (application version 0.10.108) and later.SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).\\nSCIM eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization’s identity system. This allows for:\\n\\nAutomated user management: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP.\\nReduced administrative overhead: No need to manage user access manually across multiple systems.\\nImproved security: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith.\\nConsistent access control: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems.\\nScaling team access control: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles.\\nRole assignment: Select specific Organization Roles and Workspace Roles for groups of users.\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SCIM.\\nFor cloud customers: SAML SSO must be configurable for your organization.\\nFor self-hosted customers: OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode must be enabled.\\nFor self-hosted customers, network traffic must be allowed from the identity provider to LangSmith:\\n\\nMicrosoft Entra ID supports allowlisting IP ranges or an agent-based solution to provide connectivity.\\n(details).\\nOkta supports allow-listing IPs or domains (details)\\nor an agent-based solution (details) to provide connectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bRole Precedence\\nWhen a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:\\n\\nOrganization Admin groups take highest precedence. Users in these groups will be Admin in all workspaces.\\nMost recently created workspace-specific group takes precedence over other workspace groups.\\n\\nWhen a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules.SCIM group membership will override manually assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.\\n\\u200bEmail verification\\nIn cloud only, creating a new user with SCIM triggers an email to the user.\\nThey must verify their email address by clicking the link in this email.\\nThe link expires in 24 hours, and can be resent if needed by removing and re-adding the user via SCIM.\\n\\u200bAttributes and Mapping\\n\\u200bGroup Naming Convention\\nGroup membership maps to LangSmith workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:\\nOrganization Admin Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix>Organization Admin or <optional_prefix>Organization Admins\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization Admins\\nGroups-Organization Admins\\nOrganization Admin\\n\\nWorkspace-Specific Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix><org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization User:Production:Annotators\\nGroups-Organization User:Engineering:Developers\\nOrganization User:Marketing:Viewers\\n\\n\\u200bMapping\\nWhile specific instructions depending on the identity provider may vary, these mappings show what is supported by the LangSmith SCIM integration:\\n\\u200bUser Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserName1email addressactive!deactivatedemails[type eq \"work\"].valueemail address2name.formatteddisplayName OR givenName + familyName3givenNamegivenNamefamilyNamefamilyNameexternalIdsub41\\n\\nuserName is not required by LangSmith\\nEmail address is required\\nUse the computed expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion for cloud customers, or the sub OAuth2.0 claim for self-hosted.\\n\\n\\u200bGroup Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description identity provider attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\n\\u200bStep 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)\\nThere are two scenarios for SAML SSO configuration:\\n\\nIf SAML SSO is already configured for your organization, you should skip the steps to initially add the application (Add application from Okta Integration Network or Create a new Entra ID application integration), as you already have an application configured and just need to enable provisioning.\\nIf you are configuring SAML SSO for the first time alongside SCIM, first follow the instructions to set up SAML SSO, then follow the instructions here to enable SCIM.\\n\\n\\u200bNameID Format\\nLangSmith uses the SAML NameID to identify users. The NameID is a required field in the SAML response and is case-insensitive.\\nThe NameID must:\\n\\nBe unique to each user.\\nBe a persistent value that never changes, such as a randomly generated unique user ID.\\nMatch exactly on each sign-in attempt. It should not rely on user input.\\n\\nThe NameID should not be an email address or username because email addresses and usernames are more likely to change over time and can be case-sensitive.\\nThe NameID format must be Persistent, unless you are using a field, like email, that requires a different format.\\n\\u200bStep 2: Disable JIT provisioning\\nBefore enabling SCIM, disable Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning.\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Cloud\\nUse the PATCH /orgs/current/info endpoint:\\nCopycurl -X PATCH $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/orgs/current/info \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"jit_provisioning_enabled\": false}\\'\\n\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Self-Hosted\\nAs of LangSmith chart version 0.11.14, you can disable JIT provisioning for your self-hosted organization using SSO. To disable, set the following values:\\nCopycommonEnv:\\n  - name: SELF_HOSTED_JIT_PROVISIONING_ENABLED\\n    value: \"false\"\\n\\n\\u200bStep 3: Generate SCIM bearer token\\nIn self-hosted environments, the full URL below may look like https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (without a subdomain, note the /api/v1 path prefix) or https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/subdomain/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (with a subdomain) - see the ingress docs for more details.\\nGenerate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests. Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:\\nCopycurl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"description\": \"Your description here\"}\\'\\n\\nNote that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request. These additional endpoints are present:\\n\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\nPATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id} (only the description field is supported)\\nDELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\n\\n\\u200bStep 4: Configure your Identity Provider\\nIf you use Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) or Okta, there are specific instructions for identity provider setup (refer to Azure Entra ID, Okta). The requirements and steps above are applicable for all identity providers.\\n\\u200bAzure Entra ID configuration steps\\nFor additional information, see Microsoft’s documentation.\\nIn self-hosted installations, the oid JWT claim is used as the sub.\\nSee this Microsoft Learn link\\nand the related configuration instructions for additional details.\\nStep 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application\\n\\nLog in to the Azure portal with a privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator).\\nNavigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nIn the left-side navigation, select Manage > Provisioning.\\nClick Get started.\\n\\nStep 2: Configure Admin credentials\\n\\n\\nUnder Admin Credentials:\\n\\n\\nTenant URL:\\n\\nUS: https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nEU: https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nSelf-hosted: <langsmith_url>/scim/v2\\n\\n\\n\\nSecret Token: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick Test Connection to verify the configuration.\\n\\n\\nClick Save.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Configure Attribute Mappings\\nConfigure the following attribute mappings under Mappings:\\nUser Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserNameuserPrincipalNameactiveNot([IsSoftDeleted])emails[type eq \"work\"].valuemail1name.formatteddisplayName OR Join(\" \", [givenName], [surname])2externalIdobjectId31\\n\\nUser’s email address must be present in Entra ID.\\nUse the Join expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname.\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion and the sub OAuth2.0 claim.

If you are interested in this feature, contact our sales team. Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\\nYou may find it helpful to read the Administration overview page before setting up access control.\\nLangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions within a workspace. This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the workspace:manage permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.\\n\\u200bCreate a role\\nBy default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:\\n\\nAdmin: has full access to all resources within the workspace.\\nViewer: has read-only access to all resources within the workspace.\\nEditor: has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys).\\n\\nIf these do not fit your access model, Organization Admins can create custom roles to suit your needs.\\nTo create a role, navigate to the Roles tab in the Members and roles section of the Organization settings page. Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.\\nClick on the Create Role button to create a new role. A Create role form will open.\\n\\nAssign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.\\n\\u200bAssign a role to a user\\nOnce you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the Workspace members tab in the Workspaces section of the Organization settings page\\nEach user will have a Role dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.\\n\\nYou can also invite new users with a given role.\\n\\n\\u200bSet up SAML SSO for your organization\\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise Cloud customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.\\nLangSmith’s SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.\\nSSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. The benefits of SSO include:\\n\\nStreamlines user management across systems for organization owners.\\nEnables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g., MFA).\\nRemoves the need for end users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies the end-user experience, by allowing sign in at one single access point across multiple applications.\\n\\n\\u200bJust-in-time (JIT) provisioning\\nLangSmith supports Just-in-time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.\\nJIT provisioning only runs for new users, that is, users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a different login method.\\n\\u200bLogin methods and access\\nOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other login methods, such as username/password or Google Authentication”:\\n\\nWhen logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.\\nUsers with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have personal organizations.\\nWhen logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of.\\n\\n\\u200bEnforce SAML SSO only\\nTo ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the Login via SSO only checkbox and click Save. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking Save.\\nYou must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to Only SAML SSO. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs. If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, reach out to the LangChain support team at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nSAML SSO is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Please contact sales to learn more.\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SAML SSO.\\n\\nFor instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning, refer to the SCIM setup.\\n\\u200bInitial configuration\\nFor IdP-specific configuration steps, refer to one of the following:\\nEntra ID\\nGoogle\\nOkta\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3.\\nThe following URLs are different for the US and EU regions.

You can find this in the LangSmith UI under Organization members and roles then SSO configuration.\\n\\u200bSet up SCIM for your organization\\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and de-provision users in your LangSmith organization and workspaces, keeping user access synchronized with your organization’s identity provider.\\nSCIM is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Contact sales to learn more.SCIM is available on Helm chart versions 0.10.41 (application version 0.10.108) and later.SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).\\nSCIM eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization’s identity system. This allows for:\\n\\nAutomated user management: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP.\\nReduced administrative overhead: No need to manage user access manually across multiple systems.\\nImproved security: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith.\\nConsistent access control: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems.\\nScaling team access control: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles.\\nRole assignment: Select specific Organization Roles and Workspace Roles for groups of users.\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SCIM.\\nFor cloud customers: SAML SSO must be configurable for your organization.\\nFor self-hosted customers: OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode must be enabled.\\nFor self-hosted customers, network traffic must be allowed from the identity provider to LangSmith:\\n\\nMicrosoft Entra ID supports allowlisting IP ranges or an agent-based solution to provide connectivity.\\n(details).\\nOkta supports allow-listing IPs or domains (details)\\nor an agent-based solution (details) to provide connectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bRole Precedence\\nWhen a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:\\n\\nOrganization Admin groups take highest precedence. Users in these groups will be Admin in all workspaces.\\nMost recently created workspace-specific group takes precedence over other workspace groups.\\n\\nWhen a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules.SCIM group membership will override manually assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.\\n\\u200bEmail verification\\nIn cloud only, creating a new user with SCIM triggers an email to the user.\\nThey must verify their email address by clicking the link in this email.\\nThe link expires in 24 hours, and can be resent if needed by removing and re-adding the user via SCIM.\\n\\u200bAttributes and Mapping\\n\\u200bGroup Naming Convention\\nGroup membership maps to LangSmith workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:\\nOrganization Admin Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix>Organization Admin or <optional_prefix>Organization Admins\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization Admins\\nGroups-Organization Admins\\nOrganization Admin\\n\\nWorkspace-Specific Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix><org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization User:Production:Annotators\\nGroups-Organization User:Engineering:Developers\\nOrganization User:Marketing:Viewers\\n\\n\\u200bMapping\\nWhile specific instructions depending on the identity provider may vary, these mappings show what is supported by the LangSmith SCIM integration:\\n\\u200bUser Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserName1email addressactive!deactivatedemails[type eq \"work\"].valueemail address2name.formatteddisplayName OR givenName + familyName3givenNamegivenNamefamilyNamefamilyNameexternalIdsub41\\n\\nuserName is not required by LangSmith\\nEmail address is required\\nUse the computed expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion for cloud customers, or the sub OAuth2.0 claim for self-hosted.\\n\\n\\u200bGroup Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description identity provider attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\n\\u200bStep 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)\\nThere are two scenarios for SAML SSO configuration:\\n\\nIf SAML SSO is already configured for your organization, you should skip the steps to initially add the application (Add application from Okta Integration Network or Create a new Entra ID application integration), as you already have an application configured and just need to enable provisioning.\\nIf you are configuring SAML SSO for the first time alongside SCIM, first follow the instructions to set up SAML SSO, then follow the instructions here to enable SCIM.\\n\\n\\u200bNameID Format\\nLangSmith uses the SAML NameID to identify users. The NameID is a required field in the SAML response and is case-insensitive.\\nThe NameID must:\\n\\nBe unique to each user.\\nBe a persistent value that never changes, such as a randomly generated unique user ID.\\nMatch exactly on each sign-in attempt. It should not rely on user input.\\n\\nThe NameID should not be an email address or username because email addresses and usernames are more likely to change over time and can be case-sensitive.\\nThe NameID format must be Persistent, unless you are using a field, like email, that requires a different format.\\n\\u200bStep 2: Disable JIT provisioning\\nBefore enabling SCIM, disable Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning.\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Cloud\\nUse the PATCH /orgs/current/info endpoint:\\nCopycurl -X PATCH $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/orgs/current/info \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"jit_provisioning_enabled\": false}\\'\\n\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Self-Hosted\\nAs of LangSmith chart version 0.11.14, you can disable JIT provisioning for your self-hosted organization using SSO. To disable, set the following values:\\nCopycommonEnv:\\n  - name: SELF_HOSTED_JIT_PROVISIONING_ENABLED\\n    value: \"false\"\\n\\n\\u200bStep 3: Generate SCIM bearer token\\nIn self-hosted environments, the full URL below may look like https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (without a subdomain, note the /api/v1 path prefix) or https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/subdomain/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (with a subdomain) - see the ingress docs for more details.\\nGenerate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests. Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:\\nCopycurl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"description\": \"Your description here\"}\\'\\n\\nNote that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request. These additional endpoints are present:\\n\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\nPATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id} (only the description field is supported)\\nDELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\n\\n\\u200bStep 4: Configure your Identity Provider\\nIf you use Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) or Okta, there are specific instructions for identity provider setup (refer to Azure Entra ID, Okta). The requirements and steps above are applicable for all identity providers.\\n\\u200bAzure Entra ID configuration steps\\nFor additional information, see Microsoft’s documentation.\\nIn self-hosted installations, the oid JWT claim is used as the sub.\\nSee this Microsoft Learn link\\nand the related configuration instructions for additional details.\\nStep 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application\\n\\nLog in to the Azure portal with a privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator).\\nNavigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nIn the left-side navigation, select Manage > Provisioning.\\nClick Get started.\\n\\nStep 2: Configure Admin credentials\\n\\n\\nUnder Admin Credentials:\\n\\n\\nTenant URL:\\n\\nUS: https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nEU: https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nSelf-hosted: <langsmith_url>/scim/v2\\n\\n\\n\\nSecret Token: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick Test Connection to verify the configuration.\\n\\n\\nClick Save.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Configure Attribute Mappings\\nConfigure the following attribute mappings under Mappings:\\nUser Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserNameuserPrincipalNameactiveNot([IsSoftDeleted])emails[type eq \"work\"].valuemail1name.formatteddisplayName OR Join(\" \", [givenName], [surname])2externalIdobjectId31\\n\\nUser’s email address must be present in Entra ID.\\nUse the Join expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname.\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion and the sub OAuth2.0 claim.

If you’d like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.\\nTo do this, open the Organizations drawer by clicking your profile icon in the bottom left and click + New. Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to set up billing to proceed.\\n\\u200bManage and navigate workspaces\\nOnce you’ve subscribed to a plan that allows for multiple users per organization, you can set up workspaces to collaborate more effectively and isolate LangSmith resources between different groups of users. To navigate between workspaces and access the resources within each workspace (trace projects, annotation queues, etc.), select the desired workspace from the picker in the top left:\\n\\n\\u200bManage users\\nManage membership in your shared organization in the Members and roles tabs on the Settings page. Here you can:\\n\\nInvite new users to your organization, selecting workspace membership and (if RBAC is enabled) workspace role.\\nEdit a user’s organization role.\\nRemove users from your organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganizations on the Enterprise plan may set up custom workspace roles in the Roles tab. For more details, refer to the access control setup guide.\\n\\u200bOrganization roles\\nOrganization-scoped roles are used to determine access to organization settings. The role selected also impacts workspace membership:\\n\\nOrganization Admin grants full access to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces. Any Organization Admin has Admin access to all workspaces in an organization.\\n\\n\\nOrganization User may read organization information, but cannot execute any write actions at the organization level. You can add an Organization User to a subset of workspaces and assigned workspace roles as usual (if RBAC is enabled), which specify permissions at the workspace level.\\n\\nThe Organization User role is only available in organizations on plans with multiple workspaces. In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are Organization Admins. Custom organization-scoped roles are not available.\\nFor a full list of permissions associated with each role, refer to the Administration overview page.\\n\\u200bSet up a workspace\\nWhen you log in for the first time, a default workspace will be created for you in your personal organization. Workspaces are often used to separate resources between different teams or business units to establish clear trust boundaries between them. Within each workspace, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manages permissions and access levels, which ensures that users only have access to the resources and settings necessary for their role. Most LangSmith activity happens in the context of a workspace, each of which has its own settings and access controls.\\nTo organize resources within a workspace, you can use resource tags.\\n\\u200bCreate a workspace\\nTo create a new workspace, navigate to the Settings page Workspaces tab in your shared organization and click Add Workspace. Once you have created your workspace, you can manage its members and other configuration by selecting it on this page.\\n\\nDifferent plans have different limits placed on the number of workspaces that can be used in an organization. For more information, refer to the pricing page.\\n\\u200bManage users\\nOnly workspace Admins can manage workspace membership and, if RBAC is enabled, change a user’s workspace role.\\nFor users that are already members of an organization, a workspace Admin may add them to a workspace in the Workspace members tab under Workspaces settings page. Users may also be invited directly to one or more workspaces when they are invited to an organization.\\n\\u200bConfigure workspace settings\\nWorkspace configuration exists in the Workspaces settings page tab. Select the workspace to configure and then the desired configuration sub-tab. The following example shows the API keys, and other configuration options including secrets, models, and shared URLs are available here as well.\\n\\n\\u200bDelete a workspace\\nDeleting a workspace will permanently delete the workspace and all associated data. This action cannot be undone.\\nYou can delete a workspace through the LangSmith UI or via API. You must be a workspace Admin in order to delete a workspace.\\n\\u200bDelete a workspace via the UI\\n\\nNavigate to Settings.\\nSelect the workspace you want to delete.\\nClick Delete in the top-right corner of the screen.\\n\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsCreate an account and API keyManage organizations using the API⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, reach out to your sales rep or support@langchain.dev.\\nYou will learn how to optimize existing spend and prevent future overspend in LangSmith, which includes:\\n\\nReducing existing costs with data retention policies.\\nPreventing future overspend with usage limits.\\n\\nThis tutorial will use an existing LangSmith organization with high usage. You can transfer the concepts from this example to your own organization. The example organization has three workspaces, one for each deployment stage (Dev, Staging, and Prod):\\n\\n\\u200bUnderstand your current usage\\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: Usage graph and Invoices.\\n\\u200bUsage graph\\nThe usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).\\nYou can navigate to the usage graph under Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage Graph.\\n\\nThis graph shows that there are two usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the data retention conceptual docs. Notice that these graphs look identical, which you will review later in the tutorial.\\nLangSmith Traces usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization. As a LangSmith administrator, you may want to understand spend granularly per each of these units. In this case where you just want to cut spend, you can focus on the environment responsible for the majority of costs first for the greatest savings.\\n\\u200bInvoices\\nYou understand what usage looks like in terms of traces, but you now need to translate that into spend. To do so, navigate to the Invoices tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month’s invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\\n\\nLangSmith’s Usage Graph and Invoice use the term tenant_id to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.\\nIn the GIF, you’ll see that the charges for LangSmith Traces are broken up by “tenant_id” (i.e., workspace ID), which means you can track tracing spend on each of the workspaces. In the first few days of June, the vast majority of the total spend of roughly $2,000 is in the production workspace. Further, the majority of spend in that workspace was on extended data retention trace upgrades.\\nThese upgrades occur for two reasons:\\n\\nYou use extended data retention tracing, which means by default your traces are retained for 400 days.\\nYou use base data retention tracing and use a feature that automatically extends the data retention of a trace. (Refer to the Auto-Upgrade conceptual docs.)\\n\\nGiven that the number of total traces per day is equal to the number of extended retention traces per day, it’s most likely the case that this organization is using extended data retention tracing everywhere. As a result, start by optimizing the retention settings.\\n\\u200bOptimization 1: manage data retention\\nLangSmith charges differently based on a trace’s data retention, where short-lived traces are an order of magnitude less expensive than ones that last for a long time. In this optimization, you’ll learn how to get optimal settings for data retention without sacrificing historical observability, and see the effect it has on the bill.\\n\\u200bChange org level retention defaults for new projects\\nNavigate to the Usage configuration tab, and look at the organization level retention settings. Modifying this setting affects all new projects that are created going forward in all workspaces in the organizaton.\\nFor backwards compatibility, older organizations may have this defaulted to Extended. Organizations created after June 3rd, 2024 have this defaulted to Base.\\n\\n\\u200bChange project level retention defaults\\nData retention settings are adjustable per project on the tracing project page.\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select Retention and modify the default retention of the project to Base. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for traces going forward.\\n\\n\\u200bApply extended data retention to a percentage of traces\\nYou may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an automation rule. You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:\\n\\n10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.\\nErrored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.\\nTraces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.\\n\\nTo configure this:\\n\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select + New > Select New Automation.\\nName your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to filtering techniques.\\n\\nWhen an automation rule matches any run within a trace, then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.\\nFor example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:\\n\\nIf you want to keep a subset of traces for longer than 400 days for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\n\\u200bSee results after 7 days\\nWhile the total amount of traces per day stayed the same, the extended data retention traces was cut heavily. In the invoice, the spend reduced to roughly $900 in the last 7 days, as opposed to $2,000 in the previous 4. That’s a cost reduction of nearly 75% per day.\\n\\n\\u200bOptimization 2: limit usage\\nIn the previous section, you managed data retention settings to optimize existing spend. In this section, you will use usage limits to prevent future overspend.\\nLangSmith has two usage limits: total traces and extended retention traces. These correspond to the two metrics tracked on the usage graph. You can use these in tandem to have granular control over spend.\\nTo set limits, navigate back to Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage configuration. There is a table at the bottom of the page that lets you set usage limits per workspace. For each workspace, the two limits appear, along with a cost estimate:\\n\\nStart by setting limits on production usage, since that is where the majority of spend comes from.\\n\\u200bSet a good total traces limit\\nPicking the right total traces limit depends on the expected load of traces that you will send to LangSmith. It is important to consider potential growth before setting a limit. For example:\\n\\nCurrent Load: The gen AI application is called between 1.2-1.5 times per second, and each API request has a trace associated with it, meaning it logs around 100,000-130,000 traces per day.\\nExpected Growth in Load: The expectation is that this will double in size in the near future.\\n\\nFrom these assumptions, you can calculate an approximate limit:\\nCopylimit = current_load_per_day * expected_growth * days/month\\n      = 130,000 * 2 * 30\\n      = 7,800,000 traces / month\\n\\nClick on the edit icon on the right side of the table for the Prod row to enter the limit.\\n\\nWhen set without the extended data retention traces limit, the maximum cost estimator assumes that all traces are using extended data retention.\\n\\u200bCut maximum spend with an extended data retention limit\\nFrom Optimization 1, you learned that the easiest way to cut cost was through managing data retention. The same is true for limits. If you only want to keep roughly 10% of traces to be around more than 14 days, you can set a limit on the maximum high retention traces you can keep. This would result in .10 * 7,800,000 = 780,000.\\n\\nThe maximum cost is cut from ~40k per month to ~7.5k per month, because you no longer allow as many expensive data retention upgrades. This ensures that new users on the platform will not accidentally cause cost to balloon.\\nThe extended data retention limit can cause features other than traces to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its functionality and side effects.\\n\\u200bSet dev/staging limits and view total spent limit across workspaces\\nFollowing a similar logic for the dev and staging environments, you can set limits at 10% of the production limit on usage for each workspace.\\nWhile this works with this usage pattern, setting good dev and staging limits may vary depending on your use case with LangSmith. For example, if you run evals as part of CI/CD in dev or staging, you may want to be more flexible with your usage limits to avoid test failures.\\nWith the limits set, LangSmith shows a maximum spend estimate across all workspaces:\\n\\nYou can use the cost estimate to plan for your invoice total.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nIf you have questions about further optimizing your spend, please reach out to support@langchain.dev.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsManage organizations using the APISet up resource tags⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

In the first few days of June, the vast majority of the total spend of roughly $2,000 is in the production workspace. Further, the majority of spend in that workspace was on extended data retention trace upgrades.\\nThese upgrades occur for two reasons:\\n\\nYou use extended data retention tracing, which means by default your traces are retained for 400 days.\\nYou use base data retention tracing and use a feature that automatically extends the data retention of a trace. (Refer to the Auto-Upgrade conceptual docs.)\\n\\nGiven that the number of total traces per day is equal to the number of extended retention traces per day, it’s most likely the case that this organization is using extended data retention tracing everywhere. As a result, start by optimizing the retention settings.\\n\\u200bOptimization 1: manage data retention\\nLangSmith charges differently based on a trace’s data retention, where short-lived traces are an order of magnitude less expensive than ones that last for a long time. In this optimization, you’ll learn how to get optimal settings for data retention without sacrificing historical observability, and see the effect it has on the bill.\\n\\u200bChange org level retention defaults for new projects\\nNavigate to the Usage configuration tab, and look at the organization level retention settings. Modifying this setting affects all new projects that are created going forward in all workspaces in the organizaton.\\nFor backwards compatibility, older organizations may have this defaulted to Extended. Organizations created after June 3rd, 2024 have this defaulted to Base.\\n\\n\\u200bChange project level retention defaults\\nData retention settings are adjustable per project on the tracing project page.\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select Retention and modify the default retention of the project to Base. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for traces going forward.\\n\\n\\u200bApply extended data retention to a percentage of traces\\nYou may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an automation rule. You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:\\n\\n10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.\\nErrored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.\\nTraces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.\\n\\nTo configure this:\\n\\nNavigate to Projects > Your project name > Select + New > Select New Automation.\\nName your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to filtering techniques.\\n\\nWhen an automation rule matches any run within a trace, then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.\\nFor example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:\\n\\nIf you want to keep a subset of traces for longer than 400 days for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\n\\u200bSee results after 7 days\\nWhile the total amount of traces per day stayed the same, the extended data retention traces was cut heavily. In the invoice, the spend reduced to roughly $900 in the last 7 days, as opposed to $2,000 in the previous 4. That’s a cost reduction of nearly 75% per day.\\n\\n\\u200bOptimization 2: limit usage\\nIn the previous section, you managed data retention settings to optimize existing spend. In this section, you will use usage limits to prevent future overspend.\\nLangSmith has two usage limits: total traces and extended retention traces. These correspond to the two metrics tracked on the usage graph. You can use these in tandem to have granular control over spend.\\nTo set limits, navigate back to Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage configuration. There is a table at the bottom of the page that lets you set usage limits per workspace. For each workspace, the two limits appear, along with a cost estimate:\\n\\nStart by setting limits on production usage, since that is where the majority of spend comes from.\\n\\u200bSet a good total traces limit\\nPicking the right total traces limit depends on the expected load of traces that you will send to LangSmith. It is important to consider potential growth before setting a limit. For example:\\n\\nCurrent Load: The gen AI application is called between 1.2-1.5 times per second, and each API request has a trace associated with it, meaning it logs around 100,000-130,000 traces per day.\\nExpected Growth in Load: The expectation is that this will double in size in the near future.\\n\\nFrom these assumptions, you can calculate an approximate limit:\\nCopylimit = current_load_per_day * expected_growth * days/month\\n      = 130,000 * 2 * 30\\n      = 7,800,000 traces / month\\n\\nClick on the edit icon on the right side of the table for the Prod row to enter the limit.\\n\\nWhen set without the extended data retention traces limit, the maximum cost estimator assumes that all traces are using extended data retention.\\n\\u200bCut maximum spend with an extended data retention limit\\nFrom Optimization 1, you learned that the easiest way to cut cost was through managing data retention. The same is true for limits. If you only want to keep roughly 10% of traces to be around more than 14 days, you can set a limit on the maximum high retention traces you can keep. This would result in .10 * 7,800,000 = 780,000.\\n\\nThe maximum cost is cut from ~40k per month to ~7.5k per month, because you no longer allow as many expensive data retention upgrades. This ensures that new users on the platform will not accidentally cause cost to balloon.\\nThe extended data retention limit can cause features other than traces to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its functionality and side effects.\\n\\u200bSet dev/staging limits and view total spent limit across workspaces\\nFollowing a similar logic for the dev and staging environments, you can set limits at 10% of the production limit on usage for each workspace.\\nWhile this works with this usage pattern, setting good dev and staging limits may vary depending on your use case with LangSmith. For example, if you run evals as part of CI/CD in dev or staging, you may want to be more flexible with your usage limits to avoid test failures.\\nWith the limits set, LangSmith shows a maximum spend estimate across all workspaces:\\n\\nYou can use the cost estimate to plan for your invoice total.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nIf you have questions about further optimizing your spend, please reach out to support@langchain.dev.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsManage organizations using the APISet up resource tags⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, reach out to your sales rep or support@langchain.dev.\\nYou will learn how to optimize existing spend and prevent future overspend in LangSmith, which includes:\\n\\nReducing existing costs with data retention policies.\\nPreventing future overspend with usage limits.\\n\\nThis tutorial will use an existing LangSmith organization with high usage. You can transfer the concepts from this example to your own organization. The example organization has three workspaces, one for each deployment stage (Dev, Staging, and Prod):\\n\\n\\u200bUnderstand your current usage\\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: Usage graph and Invoices.\\n\\u200bUsage graph\\nThe usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).\\nYou can navigate to the usage graph under Settings -> Usage and Billing -> Usage Graph.\\n\\nThis graph shows that there are two usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\\n\\nLangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.\\nLangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\\n\\nFor more details, refer to the data retention conceptual docs. Notice that these graphs look identical, which you will review later in the tutorial.\\nLangSmith Traces usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization. As a LangSmith administrator, you may want to understand spend granularly per each of these units. In this case where you just want to cut spend, you can focus on the environment responsible for the majority of costs first for the greatest savings.\\n\\u200bInvoices\\nYou understand what usage looks like in terms of traces, but you now need to translate that into spend. To do so, navigate to the Invoices tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month’s invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\\n\\nLangSmith’s Usage Graph and Invoice use the term tenant_id to refer to a workspace ID.

This guide explains the key concepts of the LangSmith evaluation framework. The building blocks of the LangSmith framework are:\\n\\nDatasets: Collections of test inputs and reference outputs.\\nEvaluators: Functions for scoring outputs. These can be online evaluators that run on traces in real time or offline evaluators that run on a dataset.\\n\\n\\u200bDatasets\\nA dataset is a collection of examples used for evaluating an application. An example is a test input, reference output pair.\\n\\n\\u200bExamples\\nEach example consists of:\\n\\nInputs: a dictionary of input variables to pass to your application.\\nReference outputs (optional): a dictionary of reference outputs. These do not get passed to your application, they are only used in evaluators.\\nMetadata (optional): a dictionary of additional information that can be used to create filtered views of a dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bDataset curation\\nThere are various ways to build datasets for evaluation, including:\\n\\u200bManually curated examples\\nThis is how we typically recommend people get started creating datasets. From building your application, you probably have some idea of what types of inputs you expect your application to be able to handle, and what “good” responses may be. You probably want to cover a few different common edge cases or situations you can imagine. Even 10-20 high-quality, manually-curated examples can go a long way.\\n\\u200bHistorical traces\\nOnce you have an application in production, you start getting valuable information: how are users actually using it? These real-world runs make for great examples because they’re, well, the most realistic!\\nIf you’re getting a lot of traffic, how can you determine which runs are valuable to add to a dataset? There are a few techniques you can use:\\n\\nUser feedback: If possible - try to collect end user feedback. You can then see which datapoints got negative feedback. That is super valuable! These are spots where your application did not perform well. You should add these to your dataset to test against in the future.\\nHeuristics: You can also use other heuristics to identify “interesting” datapoints. For example, runs that took a long time to complete could be interesting to look at and add to a dataset.\\nLLM feedback: You can use another LLM to detect noteworthy runs. For example, you could use an LLM to label chatbot conversations where the user had to rephrase their question or correct the model in some way, indicating the chatbot did not initially respond correctly.\\n\\n\\u200bSynthetic data\\nOnce you have a few examples, you can try to artificially generate some more. It’s generally advised to have a few good hand-crafted examples before this, as this synthetic data will often resemble them in some way. This can be a useful way to get a lot of datapoints, quickly.\\n\\u200bSplits\\nWhen setting up your evaluation, you may want to partition your dataset into different splits. For example, you might use a smaller split for many rapid and cheap iterations and a larger split for your final evaluation. In addition, splits can be important for the interpretability of your experiments. For example, if you have a RAG application, you may want your dataset splits to focus on different types of questions (e.g., factual, opinion, etc) and to evaluate your application on each split separately.\\nLearn how to create and manage dataset splits.\\n\\u200bVersions\\nDatasets are versioned such that every time you add, update, or delete examples in your dataset, a new version of the dataset is created. This makes it easy to inspect and revert changes to your dataset in case you make a mistake. You can also tag versions of your dataset to give them a more human-readable name. This can be useful for marking important milestones in your dataset’s history.\\nYou can run evaluations on specific versions of a dataset. This can be useful when running evaluations in CI, to make sure that a dataset update doesn’t accidentally break your CI pipelines.\\n\\u200bEvaluators\\nEvaluators are functions that score how well your application performs on a particular example.\\n\\u200bEvaluator inputs\\nEvaluators receive these inputs:\\n\\nExample: The example(s) from your Dataset. Contains inputs, (reference) outputs, and metadata.\\nRun: The actual outputs and intermediate steps (child runs) from passing the example inputs to the application.\\n\\n\\u200bEvaluator outputs\\nAn evaluator returns one or more metrics. These should be returned as a dictionary or list of dictionaries of the form:\\n\\nkey: The name of the metric.\\nscore | value: The value of the metric. Use score if it’s a numerical metric and value if it’s categorical.\\ncomment (optional): The reasoning or additional string information justifying the score.\\n\\n\\u200bDefining evaluators\\nThere are a number of ways to define and run evaluators:\\n\\nCustom code: Define custom evaluators as Python or TypeScript functions and run them client-side using the SDKs or server-side via the UI.\\nBuilt-in evaluators: LangSmith has a number of built-in evaluators that you can configure and run via the UI.\\n\\nYou can run evaluators using the LangSmith SDK (Python and TypeScript), via the Prompt Playground, or by configuring Rules to automatically run them on particular tracing projects or datasets.\\n\\u200bEvaluation techniques\\nThere are a few high-level approaches to LLM evaluation:\\n\\u200bHuman\\nHuman evaluation is often a great starting point for evaluation. LangSmith makes it easy to review your LLM application outputs as well as the traces (all intermediate steps).\\nLangSmith’s annotation queues make it easy to get human feedback on your application’s outputs.\\n\\u200bHeuristic\\nHeuristic evaluators are deterministic, rule-based functions. These are good for simple checks like making sure that a chatbot’s response isn’t empty, that a snippet of generated code can be compiled, or that a classification is exactly correct.\\n\\u200bLLM-as-judge\\nLLM-as-judge evaluators use LLMs to score the application’s output. To use them, you typically encode the grading rules / criteria in the LLM prompt. They can be reference-free (e.g., check if system output contains offensive content or adheres to specific criteria). Or, they can compare task output to a reference output (e.g., check if the output is factually accurate relative to the reference).\\nWith LLM-as-judge evaluators, it is important to carefully review the resulting scores and tune the grader prompt if needed. Often it is helpful to write these as few-shot evaluators, where you provide examples of inputs, outputs, and expected grades as part of the grader prompt.\\nLearn about how to define an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator.\\n\\u200bPairwise\\nPairwise evaluators allow you to compare the outputs of two versions of an application. Think LMSYS Chatbot Arena - this is the same concept, but applied to AI applications more generally, not just models! This can use either a heuristic (“which response is longer”), an LLM (with a specific pairwise prompt), or human (asking them to manually annotate examples).\\nWhen should you use pairwise evaluation?\\nPairwise evaluation is helpful when it is difficult to directly score an LLM output, but easier to compare two outputs. This can be the case for tasks like summarization - it may be hard to give a summary an absolute score, but easy to choose which of two summaries is more informative.\\nLearn how run pairwise evaluations.\\n\\u200bExperiment\\nEach time we evaluate an application on a dataset, we are conducting an experiment. An experiment contains the results of running a specific version of your application on the dataset. To understand how to use the LangSmith experiment view, see how to analyze experiment results.\\n\\nTypically, we will run multiple experiments on a given dataset, testing different configurations of our application (e.g., different prompts or LLMs). In LangSmith, you can easily view all the experiments associated with your dataset. Additionally, you can compare multiple experiments in a comparison view.\\n\\n\\u200bExperiment configuration\\nLangSmith supports a number of experiment configurations which make it easier to run your evals in the manner you want.\\n\\u200bRepetitions\\nRunning an experiment multiple times can be helpful since LLM outputs are not deterministic and can differ from one repetition to the next. By running multiple repetitions, you can get a more accurate estimate of the performance of your system.\\nRepetitions can be configured by passing the num_repetitions argument to evaluate / aevaluate (Python, TypeScript). Repeating the experiment involves both re-running the target function to generate outputs and re-running the evaluators.\\nTo learn more about running repetitions on experiments, read the how-to-guide.\\n\\u200bConcurrency\\nBy passing the max_concurrency argument to evaluate / aevaluate, you can specify the concurrency of your experiment. The max_concurrency argument has slightly different semantics depending on whether you are using evaluate or aevaluate.\\nevaluate\\nThe max_concurrency argument to evaluate specifies the maximum number of concurrent threads to use when running the experiment. This is both for when running your target function as well as your evaluators.\\naevaluate\\nThe max_concurrency argument to aevaluate is fairly similar to evaluate, but instead uses a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent tasks that can run at once. aevaluate works by creating a task for each example in the dataset. Each task consists of running the target function as well as all of the evaluators on that specific example. The max_concurrency argument specifies the maximum number of concurrent tasks, or put another way - examples, to run at once.\\n\\u200bCaching\\nLastly, you can also cache the API calls made in your experiment by setting the LANGSMITH_TEST_CACHE to a valid folder on your device with write access. This will cause the API calls made in your experiment to be cached to disk, meaning future experiments that make the same API calls will be greatly sped up.\\n\\u200bAnnotation queues\\nHuman feedback is often the most valuable feedback you can gather on your application. With annotation queues you can flag runs of your application for annotation. Human annotators then have a streamlined view to review and provide feedback on the runs in a queue. Often (some subset of) these annotated runs are then transferred to a dataset for future evaluations. While you can always annotate runs inline, annotation queues provide another option to group runs together, specify annotation criteria, and configure permissions.\\nLearn more about annotation queues and human feedback.\\n\\u200bOffline evaluation\\nEvaluating an application on a dataset is what we call “offline” evaluation. It is offline because we’re evaluating on a pre-compiled set of data. An online evaluation, on the other hand, is one in which we evaluate a deployed application’s outputs on real traffic, in near realtime. Offline evaluations are used for testing a version(s) of your application pre-deployment.\\nYou can run offline evaluations client-side using the LangSmith SDK (Python and TypeScript). You can run them server-side via the Prompt Playground or by configuring automations to run certain evaluators on every new experiment against a specific dataset.\\n\\n\\u200bBenchmarking\\nPerhaps the most common type of offline evaluation is one in which we curate a dataset of representative inputs, define the key performance metrics, and benchmark multiple versions of our application to find the best one. Benchmarking can be laborious because for many use cases you have to curate a dataset with gold-standard reference outputs and design good metrics for comparing experimental outputs to them. For a RAG Q&A bot this might look like a dataset of questions and reference answers, and an LLM-as-judge evaluator that determines if the actual answer is semantically equivalent to the reference answer. For a ReACT agent this might look like a dataset of user requests and a reference set of all the tool calls the model is supposed to make, and a heuristic evaluator that checks if all of the reference tool calls were made.\\n\\u200bUnit tests\\nUnit tests are used in software development to verify the correctness of individual system components. Unit tests in the context of LLMs are often rule-based assertions on LLM inputs or outputs (e.g., checking that LLM-generated code can be compiled, JSON can be loaded, etc.) that validate basic functionality.\\nUnit tests are often written with the expectation that they should always pass. These types of tests are nice to run as part of CI. Note that when doing so it is useful to set up a cache to minimize LLM calls (because those can quickly rack up!).\\n\\u200bRegression tests\\nRegression tests are used to measure performance across versions of your application over time. They are used to, at the very least, ensure that a new app version does not regress on examples that your current version correctly handles, and ideally to measure how much better your new version is relative to the current. Often these are triggered when you are making app updates (e.g. updating models or architectures) that are expected to influence the user experience.\\nLangSmith’s comparison view has native support for regression testing, allowing you to quickly see examples that have changed relative to the baseline. Regressions are highlighted red, improvements green.\\n\\n\\u200bBacktesting\\nBacktesting is an approach that combines dataset creation (discussed above) with evaluation. If you have a collection of production logs, you can turn them into a dataset. Then, you can re-run those production examples with newer application versions. This allows you to assess performance on past and realistic user inputs.\\nThis is commonly used to evaluate new model versions. Anthropic dropped a new model? No problem! Grab the 1000 most recent runs through your application and pass them through the new model. Then compare those results to what actually happened in production.\\n\\u200bPairwise evaluation\\nFor some tasks it is easier for a human or LLM grader to determine if “version A is better than B” than to assign an absolute score to either A or B. Pairwise evaluations are just this —\\xa0a scoring of the outputs of two versions against each other as opposed to against some reference output or absolute criteria. Pairwise evaluations are often useful when using LLM-as-judge evaluators on more general tasks. For example, if you have a summarizer application, it may be easier for an LLM-as-judge to determine “Which of these two summaries is more clear and concise?” than to give an absolute score like “Give this summary a score of 1-10 in terms of clarity and concision.”\\nLearn how run pairwise evaluations.\\n\\u200bOnline evaluation\\nEvaluating a deployed application’s outputs in (roughly) realtime is what we call “online” evaluation. In this case there is no dataset involved and no possibility of reference outputs — we’re running evaluators on real inputs and real outputs as they’re produced. This is useful for monitoring your application and flagging unintended behavior. Online evaluation can also work hand-in-hand with offline evaluation: for example, an online evaluator can be used to classify input questions into a set of categories that can later be used to curate a dataset for offline evaluation.\\nOnline evaluators are generally intended to be run server-side. LangSmith has built-in LLM-as-judge evaluators that you can configure, or you can define custom code evaluators that are also run within LangSmith.\\n\\n\\u200bTesting\\n\\u200bEvaluations vs testing\\nTesting and evaluation are very similar and overlapping concepts that often get confused.\\nAn evaluation measures performance according to a metric(s). Evaluation metrics can be fuzzy or subjective, and are more useful in relative terms than absolute ones. That is, they’re often used to compare two systems against each other rather than to assert something about an individual system.\\nTesting asserts correctness. A system can only be deployed if it passes all tests.\\nEvaluation metrics can be turned into tests. For example, you can write regression tests to assert that any new version of a system must outperform some baseline version of the system on the relevant evaluation metrics.\\nIt can also be more resource efficient to run tests and evaluations together if your system is expensive to run and you have overlapping datasets for your tests and evaluations.\\nYou can also choose to write evaluations using standard software testing tools like pytest or vitest/jest out of convenience.\\n\\u200bUsing pytest and Vitest/Jest\\nThe LangSmith SDKs come with integrations for pytest and Vitest/Jest. These make it easy to:\\n\\nTrack test results in LangSmith\\nWrite evaluations as tests\\n\\nTracking test results in LangSmith makes it easy to share results, compare systems, and debug failing tests.\\nWriting evaluations as tests can be useful when each example you want to evaluate on requires custom logic for running the application and/or evaluators. The standard evaluation flows assume that you can run your application and evaluators in the same way on every example in a dataset. But for more complex systems or comprehensive evals, you may want to evaluate specific subsets of your system with specific types of inputs and metrics. These types of heterogenous evals are much easier to write as a suite of distinct test cases that all get tracked together rather than using the standard evaluate flow.\\nUsing testing tools is also helpful when you want to both evaluate your system’s outputs and assert some basic things about them.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewEvaluation approaches⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

It is still worthwhile to read this guide first, as the two have identical interfaces, before reading the how-to guide on running an evaluation asynchronously.In JS/TS evaluate() is already asynchronous so no separate method is needed.It is also important to configure the max_concurrency/maxConcurrency arg when running large jobs. This parallelizes evaluation by effectively splitting the dataset across threads.\\n\\u200bDefine an application\\nFirst we need an application to evaluate.

You can also assign a default dataset to queue, which will streamline the process of sending the inputs and outputs of certain runs to datasets in your LangSmith workspace.\\n\\u200bAnnotation Rubric\\nBegin by drafting some high-level instructions for your annotators, which will be shown in the sidebar on every run.\\nNext, click ”+ Desired Feedback” to add feedback keys to your annotation queue. Annotators will be presented with these feedback keys on each run. Add a description for each, as well as a short description of each category if the feedback is categorical.\\n\\nReviewers will see this:\\n\\n\\u200bCollaborator Settings\\nThere are a few settings related to multiple annotators:\\n\\n\\nNumber of reviewers per run: This determines the number of reviewers that must mark a run as “Done” for it to be removed from the queue. If you check “All workspace members review each run,” then a run will remain in the queue until all workspace members have marked it “Done”.\\n\\nReviewers cannot view the feedback left by other reviewers.\\nComments on runs are visible to all reviewers.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnable reservations on runs: We recommend enabling reservations. This will prevent multiple annotators from reviewing the same run at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do reservations work?\\n\\nWhen a reviewer views a run, the run is reserved for that reviewer for the specified “reservation length”. If there are multiple reviewers per run as specified above, the run can be reserved by multiple reviewers (up to the number of reviewers per run) at the same time.\\n\\nWhat happens if time runs out?\\n\\nIf a reviewer has viewed a run and then leaves the run without marking it “Done”, the reservation will expire after the specified “reservation length”. The run is then released back into the queue and can be reserved by another reviewer.\\nClicking “Requeue at end” will only move the current run to the end of the current user’s queue; it won’t affect the queue order of any other user. It will also release the reservation that the current user has on that run.\\nBecause of these settings, it’s possible (and likely) that the number of runs visible to an individual in an annotation queue differs from the total number of runs in the queue as well as anyone else’s queue size.\\nYou can update these settings at any time by clicking on the pencil icon in the Annotation Queues section.\\n\\n\\u200bAssign runs to an annotation queue\\nTo assign runs to an annotation queue, either:\\n\\n\\nClick on Add to Annotation Queue in top right corner of any trace view. You can add ANY intermediate run (span) of the trace to an annotation queue, not just the root span. \\n\\n\\nSelect multiple runs in the runs table then click Add to Annotation Queue at the bottom of the page. \\n\\n\\nSet up an automation rule that automatically assigns runs which pass a certain filter and sampling condition to an annotation queue.\\n\\n\\nSelect one or multiple experiments from the dataset page and click Annotate. From the resulting popup, you may either create a new queue or add the runs to an existing one: \\n\\n\\nIt is often a very good idea to assign runs that have a certain user feedback score (eg thumbs up, thumbs down) from the application to an annotation queue. This way, you can identify and address issues that are causing user dissatisfaction. To learn more about how to capture user feedback from your LLM application, follow this guide.\\n\\u200bReview runs in an annotation queue\\nTo review runs in an annotation queue, navigate to the Annotation Queues section through the homepage or left-hand navigation bar. Then click on the queue you want to review. This will take you to a focused, cyclical view of the runs in the queue that require review.\\nYou can attach a comment, attach a score for a particular feedback criteria, add the run a dataset and/or mark the run as reviewed. You can also remove the run from the queue for all users, despite any current reservations or settings for the queue, by clicking the Trash icon next to “View run”.\\nThe keyboard shortcuts shown can help streamline the review process.\\n\\n\\u200bVideo guide\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsUpload experiments run outside of LangSmithSet up feedback criteria⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Specify the number of few-shot examples to useMake correctionsView your corrections datasetSet up evaluationsImprove evaluatorsHow to improve your evaluator with few-shot examplesCopy pageCopy pageUsing LLM-as-a-judge evaluators can be very helpful when you can’t evaluate your system programmatically. However, their effectiveness depends on their quality and how well they align with human reviewer feedback. LangSmith provides the ability to improve the alignment of LLM-as-a-judge evaluator to human preferences using few-shot examples.\\nHuman corrections are automatically inserted into your evaluator prompt using few-shot examples. Few-shot examples is a technique inspired by few-shot prompting that guides the models output with a few high-quality examples.\\nThis guide covers how to set up few-shot examples as part of your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator and apply corrections to feedback scores.\\n\\u200bHow few-shot examples work\\n\\nFew-shot examples are added to your evaluator prompt using the {{Few-shot examples}} variable\\nCreating an evaluator with few-shot examples, will automatically create a dataset for you, which will be auto-populated with few-shot examples once you start making corrections\\nAt runtime, these examples will inserted into the evaluator to serve as a guide for its outputs - this will help the evaluator to better align with human preferences\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure your evaluator\\nFew-shot examples are not currently supported in LLM-as-a-judge evaluators that use the prompt hub and are only compatible with prompts that use mustache formatting.\\nBefore enabling few-shot examples, set up your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator. If you haven’t done this yet, follow the steps in the LLM-as-a-judge evaluator guide.\\n\\u200b1. Configure variable mapping\\nEach few-shot example is formatted according to the variable mapping specified in the configuration. The variable mapping for few-shot examples, should contain the same variables as your main prompt, plus a few_shot_explanation and a score variable which should have the same name as your feedback key.\\nFor example, if your main prompt has variables question and response, and your evaluator outputs a correctness score, then your few-shot prompt should have the vartiables question, response, few_shot_explanation, and correctness.\\n\\u200b2. Specify the number of few-shot examples to use\\nYou may also specify the number of few-shot examples to use. The default is 5. If your examples are very long, you may want to set this number lower to save tokens - whereas if your examples tend to be short, you can set a higher number in order to give your evaluator more examples to learn from. If you have more examples in your dataset than this number, we will randomly choose them for you.\\n\\u200bMake corrections\\nAudit evaluator scores\\nAs you start logging traces or running experiments, you will likely disagree with some of the scores that your evaluator has given. When you make corrections to these scores, you will begin seeing examples populated inside your corrections dataset. As you make corrections, make sure to attach explanations - these will get populated into your evaluator prompt in place of the few_shot_explanation variable.\\nThe inputs to the few-shot examples will be the relevant fields from the inputs, outputs, and reference (if this an offline evaluator) of your chain/dataset. The outputs will be the corrected evaluator score and the explanations that you created when you left the corrections. Feel free to edit these to your liking. Here is an example of a few-shot example in a corrections dataset:\\n\\nNote that the corrections may take a minute or two to be populated into your few-shot dataset. Once they are there, future runs of your evaluator will include them in the prompt!\\n\\u200bView your corrections dataset\\nIn order to view your corrections dataset:\\n\\nOnline evaluators: Select your run rule and click Edit Rule\\nOffline evaluators: Select your evaluator and click Edit Evaluator\\n\\n\\nHead to your dataset of corrections linked in the the Improve evaluator accuracy using few-shot examples section.

These functions can be passed directly into evaluate() / aevaluate().\\n\\u200bBasic example\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import evaluate\\n\\ndef correct(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"Check if the answer exactly matches the expected answer.\"\"\"\\n    return outputs[\"answer\"] == reference_outputs[\"answer\"]\\n\\ndef dummy_app(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    return {\"answer\": \"hmm i\\'m not sure\", \"reasoning\": \"i didn\\'t understand the question\"}\\n\\nresults = evaluate(\\n    dummy_app,\\n    data=\"dataset_name\",\\n    evaluators=[correct]\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bEvaluator args\\ncode evaluator functions must have specific argument names. They can take any subset of the following arguments:\\n\\nrun: Run: The full Run object generated by the application on the given example.\\nexample: Example: The full dataset Example, including the example inputs, outputs (if available), and metdata (if available).\\ninputs: dict: A dictionary of the inputs corresponding to a single example in a dataset.\\noutputs: dict: A dictionary of the outputs generated by the application on the given inputs.\\nreference_outputs/referenceOutputs: dict: A dictionary of the reference outputs associated with the example, if available.\\n\\nFor most use cases you’ll only need inputs, outputs, and reference_outputs. run and example are useful only if you need some extra trace or example metadata outside of the actual inputs and outputs of the application.\\nWhen using JS/TS these should all be passed in as part of a single object argument.\\n\\u200bEvaluator output\\nCode evaluators are expected to return one of the following types:\\nPython and JS/TS\\n\\ndict: dicts of the form {\"score\" | \"value\": ..., \"key\": ...} allow you to customize the metric type (“score” for numerical and “value” for categorical) and metric name. This if useful if, for example, you want to log an integer as a categorical metric.\\n\\nPython only\\n\\nint | float | bool: this is interepreted as an continuous metric that can be averaged, sorted, etc. The function name is used as the name of the metric.\\nstr: this is intepreted as a categorical metric. The function name is used as the name of the metric.\\nlist[dict]: return multiple metrics using a single function.\\n\\n\\u200bAdditional examples\\nRequires langsmith>=0.2.0\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import evaluate, wrappers\\nfrom langsmith.schemas import Run, Example\\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\\n# Assumes you\\'ve installed pydantic.\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\n\\n# We can still pass in Run and Example objects if we\\'d like\\ndef correct_old_signature(run: Run, example: Example) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"Check if the answer exactly matches the expected answer.\"\"\"\\n    return {\"key\": \"correct\", \"score\": run.outputs[\"answer\"] == example.outputs[\"answer\"]}\\n\\n# Just evaluate actual outputs\\ndef concision(outputs: dict) -> int:\\n    \"\"\"Score how concise the answer is. 1 is the most concise, 5 is the least concise.\"\"\"\\n    return min(len(outputs[\"answer\"]) // 1000, 4) + 1\\n\\n# Use an LLM-as-a-judge\\noai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(AsyncOpenAI())\\n\\nasync def valid_reasoning(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"Use an LLM to judge if the reasoning and the answer are consistent.\"\"\"\\n    instructions = \"\"\"\\\\\\nGiven the following question, answer, and reasoning, determine if the reasoning for the \\\\\\nanswer is logically valid and consistent with question and the answer.\"\"\"\\n\\n    class Response(BaseModel):\\n        reasoning_is_valid: bool\\n\\n    msg = f\"Question: {inputs[\\'question\\']}\\\\nAnswer: {outputs[\\'answer\\']}\\\\nReasoning: {outputs[\\'reasoning\\']}\"\\n    response = await oai_client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions,}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": msg}],\\n        response_format=Response\\n    )\\n    return response.choices[0].message.parsed.reasoning_is_valid\\n\\ndef dummy_app(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    return {\"answer\": \"hmm i\\'m not sure\", \"reasoning\": \"i didn\\'t understand the question\"}\\n\\nresults = evaluate(\\n    dummy_app,\\n    data=\"dataset_name\",\\n    evaluators=[correct_old_signature, concision, valid_reasoning]\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bRelated\\n\\nEvaluate aggregate experiment results: Define summary evaluators, which compute metrics for an entire experiment.\\nRun an evaluation comparing two experiments: Define pairwise evaluators, which compute metrics by comparing two (or more) experiments against each other.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsUse prebuilt evaluatorsLLM-as-a-judge evaluator⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

When using evaluate() (Python/TypeScript)we’ll do this by passing in a target function argument. This is a function that takes in a dataset Example’s inputs and returns the application output as a dict. Within this function we can call our application however we’d like. We can also format the output however we’d like. The key is that any evaluator functions we define should work with the output format we return in our target function.\\nCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\n# \\'inputs\\' will come from your dataset.\\ndef dummy_target(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    return {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": \"two\"}\\n\\n# \\'inputs\\' will come from your dataset.\\n# \\'outputs\\' will come from your target function.\\ndef evaluator_one(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    return outputs[\"foo\"] == 2\\n\\ndef evaluator_two(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    return len(outputs[\"bar\"]) < 3\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nresults = client.evaluate(\\n    dummy_target,  # <-- target function\\n    data=\"your-dataset-name\",\\n    evaluators=[evaluator_one, evaluator_two],\\n    ...\\n)\\n\\nevaluate() will automatically trace your target function.

This is especially helpful if you have long inputs/outputs/reference outputs and want to surface important fields.\\nHide and reorder columns to create focused views for analysis.\\nControl decimal precision on feedback scores. By default, LangSmith surfaces numerical feedback scores with a decimal precision of 2, but you can customize this setting to be up to 6 decimals.\\nSet the Heat Map threshold to high, middle, and low for numeric feedback scores in your experiment, which affects the threshold at which score chips render as red or green:\\n\\n\\nYou can set default configurations for an entire dataset or temporarily save settings just for yourself.\\n\\u200bSort and filter\\nTo sort or filter feedback scores, you can use the actions in the column headers.\\n\\n\\u200bTable views\\nDepending on the view most useful for your analysis, you can change the formatting of the table by toggling between a compact view, a full, view, and a diff view.\\n\\nThe Compact view shows each run as a one-line row, for ease of comparing scores at a glance.\\nThe Full view shows the full output for each run for digging into the details of individual runs.\\nThe Diff view shows the text difference between the reference output and the output for each run.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bView the traces\\nHover over any of the output cells, and click on the trace icon to view the trace for that run. This will open up a trace in the side panel.\\nTo view the entire tracing project, click on the View Project button in the top right of the header.\\n\\n\\u200bView evaluator runs\\nFor evaluator scores, you can view the source run by hovering over the evaluator score cell and clicking on the arrow icon. This will open up a trace in the side panel. If you’re running a LLM-as-a-judge evaluator, you can view the prompt used for the evaluator in this run. If your experiment has repetitions, you can click on the aggregate average score to find links to all of the individual runs.\\n\\n\\u200bGroup results by metadata\\nYou can add metadata to examples to categorize and organize them. For example, if you’re evaluating factual accuracy on a question answering dataset, the metadata might include which subject area each question belongs to. Metadata can be added either via the UI or via the SDK.\\nTo analyze results by metadata, use the Group by dropdown in the top right corner of the experiment view and select your desired metadata key. This displays average feedback scores, latency, total tokens, and cost for each metadata group.\\nYou will only be able to group by example metadata on experiments created after February 20th, 2025. Any experiments before that date can still be grouped by metadata, but only if the metadata is on the experiment traces themselves.\\n\\u200bRepetitions\\nIf you’ve run your experiment with repetitions, there will be arrows in the output results column so you can view outputs in the table. To view each run from the repetition, hover over the output cell and click the expanded view.\\nWhen you run an experiment with repetitions, LangSmith displays the average for each feedback score in the table. Click on the feedback score to view the feedback scores from individual runs, or to view the standard deviation across repetitions.\\n\\n\\u200bCompare to another experiment\\nIn the top right of the experiment view, you can select another experiment to compare to. This will open up a comparison view, where you can see how the two experiments compare. To learn more about the comparison view, see how to compare experiment results.\\n\\u200bDownload experiment results as a CSV\\nLangSmith lets you download experiment results as a CSV file, which allows you to analyze and share your results.\\nTo download as a CSV, click the download icon at the top of the experiment view. The icon is directly to the left of the Compact toggle.\\n\\n\\u200bRename an experiment\\nExperiment names must be unique per workspace.\\nYou can rename an experiment in the LangSmith UI in:\\n\\n\\nThe Playground. When running experiments in the Playground, a default name with the format pg::prompt-name::model::uuid (eg. pg::gpt-4o-mini::897ee630) is automatically assigned.\\nYou can rename an experiment immediately after running it by editing its name in the Playground table header.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Experiments view. When viewing results in the experiments view, you can rename an experiment by using the pencil icon beside the experiment name.\\n\\n\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsRun backtests on a new version of an agentCompare experiment results⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

It is still worthwhile to read this guide first, as the two have identical interfaces, before reading the how-to guide on running an evaluation asynchronously.In JS/TS evaluate() is already asynchronous so no separate method is needed.It is also important to configure the max_concurrency/maxConcurrency arg when running large jobs. This parallelizes evaluation by effectively splitting the dataset across threads.\\n\\u200bDefine an application\\nFirst we need an application to evaluate. Let’s create a simple toxicity classifier for this example.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable, wrappers\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\n# Optionally wrap the OpenAI client to trace all model calls.\\noai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())\\n\\n# Optionally add the \\'traceable\\' decorator to trace the inputs/outputs of this function.\\n@traceable\\ndef toxicity_classifier(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    instructions = (\\n      \"Please review the user query below and determine if it contains any form of toxic behavior, \"\\n      \"such as insults, threats, or highly negative comments. Respond with \\'Toxic\\' if it does \"\\n      \"and \\'Not toxic\\' if it doesn\\'t.\"\\n    )\\n    messages = [\\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions},\\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": inputs[\"text\"]},\\n    ]\\n    result = oai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        messages=messages, model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0\\n    )\\n    return {\"class\": result.choices[0].message.content}\\n\\nWe’ve optionally enabled tracing to capture the inputs and outputs of each step in the pipeline. To understand how to annotate your code for tracing, please refer to this guide.\\n\\u200bCreate or select a dataset\\nWe need a Dataset to evaluate our application on.

They take in the example inputs, actual outputs, and, when present, the reference outputs. Since we have labels for this task, our evaluator can directly check if the actual outputs match the reference outputs.\\n\\nPython: Requires langsmith>=0.3.13\\nTypeScript: Requires langsmith>=0.2.9\\n\\nPythonTypeScriptCopydef correct(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    return outputs[\"class\"] == reference_outputs[\"label\"]\\n\\n\\u200bRun the evaluation\\nWe’ll use the evaluate() / aevaluate() methods to run the evaluation.\\nThe key arguments are:\\n\\na target function that takes an input dictionary and returns an output dictionary.

Instead of evaluating one output at a time, you can score the output from multiple experiments against each other. In this guide, you’ll use evaluate() with two existing experiments to define an evaluator and run a pairwise evaluation. Finally, you’ll use the LangSmith UI to view the pairwise experiments.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nIf you haven’t already created experiments to compare, check out the quick start or the how-to guide to get started with evaluations.\\nThis guide requires langsmith Python version >=0.2.0 or JS version >=0.2.9.\\n\\nYou can also use evaluate_comparative() with more than two existing experiments.\\n\\u200bevaluate() comparative args\\nAt its simplest, evaluate / aevaluate function takes the following arguments:\\nArgumentDescriptiontargetA list of the two existing experiments you would like to evaluate against each other. These can be uuids or experiment names.evaluatorsA list of the pairwise evaluators that you would like to attach to this evaluation. See the section below for how to define these.\\nAlong with these, you can also pass in the following optional args:\\nArgumentDescriptionrandomize_order / randomizeOrderAn optional boolean indicating whether the order of the outputs should be randomized for each evaluation. This is a strategy for minimizing positional bias in your prompt: often, the LLM will be biased towards one of the responses based on the order. This should mainly be addressed via prompt engineering, but this is another optional mitigation. Defaults to False.experiment_prefix / experimentPrefixA prefix to be attached to the beginning of the pairwise experiment name. Defaults to None.descriptionA description of the pairwise experiment. Defaults to None.max_concurrency / maxConcurrencyThe maximum number of concurrent evaluations to run. Defaults to 5.clientThe LangSmith client to use. Defaults to None.metadataMetadata to attach to your pairwise experiment. Defaults to None.load_nested / loadNestedWhether to load all child runs for the experiment. When False, only the root trace will be passed to your evaluator. Defaults to False.\\n\\u200bDefine a pairwise evaluator\\nPairwise evaluators are just functions with an expected signature.\\n\\u200bEvaluator args\\nCustom evaluator functions must have specific argument names. They can take any subset of the following arguments:\\n\\ninputs: dict: A dictionary of the inputs corresponding to a single example in a dataset.\\noutputs: list[dict]: A two-item list of the dict outputs produced by each experiment on the given inputs.\\nreference_outputs / referenceOutputs: dict: A dictionary of the reference outputs associated with the example, if available.\\nruns: list[Run]: A two-item list of the full Run objects generated by the two experiments on the given example. Use this if you need access to intermediate steps or metadata about each run.\\nexample: Example: The full dataset Example, including the example inputs, outputs (if available), and metadata (if available).\\n\\nFor most use cases you’ll only need inputs, outputs, and reference_outputs / referenceOutputs. runs and example are useful only if you need some extra trace or example metadata outside of the actual inputs and outputs of the application.\\n\\u200bEvaluator output\\nCustom evaluators are expected to return one of the following types:\\nPython and JS/TS\\n\\n\\ndict: dictionary with keys:\\n\\nkey, which represents the feedback key that will be logged\\nscores, which is a mapping from run ID to score for that run.\\ncomment, which is a string. Most commonly used for model reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently Python only\\n\\nlist[int | float | bool]: a two-item list of scores. The list is assumed to have the same order as the runs / outputs evaluator args. The evaluator function name is used for the feedback key.\\n\\nNote that you should choose a feedback key that is distinct from standard feedbacks on your run. We recommend prefixing pairwise feedback keys with pairwise_ or ranked_.\\n\\u200bRun a pairwise evaluation\\nThe following example uses a prompt which asks the LLM to decide which is better between two AI assistant responses. It uses structured output to parse the AI’s response: 0, 1, or 2.\\nIn the Python example below, we are pulling this structured prompt from the LangChain Hub and using it with a LangChain chat model wrapper.Usage of LangChain is totally optional. To illustrate this point, the TypeScript example uses the OpenAI SDK directly.\\n\\nPython: Requires langsmith>=0.2.0\\nTypeScript: Requires langsmith>=0.2.9\\n\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain import hub\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langsmith import evaluate\\n\\n# See the prompt: https://smith.langchain.com/hub/langchain-ai/pairwise-evaluation-2\\nprompt = hub.pull(\"langchain-ai/pairwise-evaluation-2\")\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o\")\\nchain = prompt | model\\n\\ndef ranked_preference(inputs: dict, outputs: list[dict]) -> list:\\n    # Assumes example inputs have a \\'question\\' key and experiment\\n    # outputs have an \\'answer\\' key.\\n    response = chain.invoke({\\n        \"question\": inputs[\"question\"],\\n        \"answer_a\": outputs[0].get(\"answer\", \"N/A\"),\\n        \"answer_b\": outputs[1].get(\"answer\", \"N/A\"),\\n    })\\n    if response[\"Preference\"] == 1:\\n        scores = [1, 0]\\n    elif response[\"Preference\"] == 2:\\n        scores = [0, 1]\\n    else:\\n        scores = [0, 0]\\n    return scores\\n\\nevaluate(\\n    (\"experiment-1\", \"experiment-2\"),  # Replace with the names/IDs of your experiments\\n    evaluators=[ranked_preference],\\n    randomize_order=True,\\n    max_concurrency=4,\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bView pairwise experiments\\nNavigate to the “Pairwise Experiments” tab from the dataset page:\\n\\nClick on a pairwise experiment that you would like to inspect, and you will be brought to the Comparison View:\\n\\nYou may filter to runs where the first experiment was better or vice versa by clicking the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons in the table header:\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSummary evaluatorRun an evaluation asynchronously⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

To learn more, please see this guide.\\nWhen updating an example with attachments, you can update attachments in a few different ways:\\n\\nPass in new attachments\\nRename existing attachments\\nDelete existing attachments\\n\\nNote that:\\n\\nAny existing attachments that are not explicitly renamed or retained will be deleted.\\nAn error will be raised if you pass in a non-existent attachment name to retain or rename.\\nNew attachments take precedence over existing attachments in case the same attachment name appears in the attachments and attachment_operations fields.\\n\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyexample_update = {\\n  \"id\": example_id,\\n  \"attachments\": {\\n      # These are net new attachments\\n      \"my_new_file\": (\"text/plain\", b\"foo bar\"),\\n  },\\n  \"inputs\": inputs,\\n  \"outputs\": outputs,\\n  # Any attachments not in rename/retain will be deleted.\\n  # In this case, that would be \"my_img\" if we uploaded it.\\n  \"attachments_operations\": {\\n      # Retained attachments will stay exactly the same\\n      \"retain\": [\"my_pdf\"],\\n      # Renaming attachments preserves the original data\\n      \"rename\": {\\n          \"my_wav\": \"my_new_wav\",\\n      }\\n  },\\n}\\n\\nls_client.update_examples(dataset_id=dataset.id, updates=[example_update])\\n\\n\\u200bUI\\n\\u200b1. Create examples with attachments\\nYou can add examples with attachments to a dataset in a few different ways.\\n\\u200bFrom existing runs\\nWhen adding runs to a LangSmith dataset, attachments can be selectively propagated from the source run to the destination example. To learn more, please see this guide.\\n\\n\\u200bFrom scratch\\nYou can create examples with attachments directly from the LangSmith UI. Click the + Example button in the Examples tab of the dataset UI. Then upload attachments using the “Upload Files” button:\\n\\nOnce uploaded, you can view examples with attachments in the LangSmith UI. Each attachment will be rendered with a preview for easy inspection. \\n\\u200b2. Create a multimodal prompt\\nThe LangSmith UI allows you to include attachments in your prompts when evaluating multimodal models:\\nFirst, click the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content. Next, add a template variable for the attachment(s) you want to include for each example.\\n\\nFor a single attachment type: Use the suggested variable name. Note: all examples must have an attachment with this name.\\nFor multiple attachments or if your attachments have varying names from one example to another: Use the All attachments variable to include all available attachments for each example.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bDefine custom evaluators\\nThe LangSmith playground does not currently support pulling multimodal content into evaluators. If this would be helpful for your use case, please let us know in the LangChain Forum (sign up here if you’re not already a member)!\\nYou can evaluate a model’s text output by adding an evaluator that takes in the example’s inputs and outputs. Even without multimodal support in your evaluators, you can still run text-only evaluations. For example:\\n\\nOCR → text correction: Use a vision model to extract text from a document, then evaluate the accuracy of the extracted output.\\nSpeech-to-text → transcription quality: Use a voice model to transcribe audio to text, then evaluate the transcription against your reference.\\n\\nFor more information on defining custom evaluators, see the LLM as Judge guide.\\n\\u200bUpdate examples with attachments\\nAttachments are limited to 20MB in size in the UI.\\nWhen editing an example in the UI, you can:\\n\\nUpload new attachments\\nRename and delete attachments\\nReset attachments to their previous state using the quick reset button\\n\\nChanges are not saved until you click submit.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsEvaluate an existing experiment (Python)Simulate multi-turn interactions⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This page describes dataset operations including:\\n\\nVersioning datasets to track changes over time.\\nFiltering and splitting datasets for evaluation.\\nSharing datasets publicly.\\nExporting datasets in various formats.\\n\\nYou’ll also learn how to export filtered traces from experiments back to datasets for further analysis and iteration.\\n\\u200bVersion a dataset\\nIn LangSmith, datasets are versioned. This means that every time you add, update, or delete examples in your dataset, a new version of the dataset is created.\\n\\u200bCreate a new version of a dataset\\nAny time you add, update, or delete examples in your dataset, a new version of your dataset is created. This allows you to track changes to your dataset over time and understand how your dataset has evolved.\\nBy default, the version is defined by the timestamp of the change. When you click on a particular version of a dataset (by timestamp) in the Examples tab, you will find the state of the dataset at that point in time.\\n\\nNote that examples are read-only when viewing a past version of the dataset. You will also see the operations that were between this version of the dataset and the latest version of the dataset.\\nBy default, the latest version of the dataset is shown in the Examples tab and experiments from all versions are shown in the Tests tab.\\nIn the Tests tab, you will find the results of tests run on the dataset at different versions.\\n\\n\\u200bTag a version\\nYou can also tag versions of your dataset to give them a more human-readable name, which can be useful for marking important milestones in your dataset’s history.\\nFor example, you might tag a version of your dataset as “prod” and use it to run tests against your LLM pipeline.\\nYou can tag a version of your dataset in the UI by clicking on + Tag this version in the Examples tab.\\n\\nYou can also tag versions of your dataset using the SDK. Here’s an example of how to tag a version of a dataset using the Python SDK:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\nclient = Client()\\ninitial_time = datetime(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) # The timestamp of the version you want to tag\\n\\n# You can tag a specific dataset version with a semantic name, like \"prod\"\\nclient.update_dataset_tag(\\n    dataset_name=toxic_dataset_name, as_of=initial_time, tag=\"prod\"\\n)\\n\\nTo run an evaluation on a particular tagged version of a dataset, refer to the Evaluate on a specific dataset version section.\\n\\u200bEvaluate on a specific dataset version\\nYou may find it helpful to refer to the following content before you read this section:\\nVersion a dataset.\\nFetching examples.\\n\\n\\u200bUse list_examples\\nYou can use evaluate / aevaluate to pass in an iterable of examples to evaluate on a particular version of a dataset.

That means when new examples are added to your dataset, they will automatically be added to your index. This process runs every few minutes, so there should be a very short delay for indexing new examples.

The scoring system works such that 0 is a completely random result, and higher scores are better. Results will be sorted in descending order according to score.\\nSearch uses a BM25-like algorithm for keyword based similarity scores. The actual score is subject to change as we improve the search algorithm, so we recommend not relying on the scores themselves, as their meaning may evolve over time.

Evaluating langgraph graphs can be challenging because a single invocation can involve many LLM calls, and which LLM calls are made may depend on the outputs of preceding calls. In this guide we will focus on the mechanics of how to pass graphs and graph nodes to evaluate() / aevaluate(). For evaluation techniques and best practices when building agents head to the langgraph docs.\\n\\u200bEnd-to-end evaluations\\nThe most common type of evaluation is an end-to-end one, where we want to evaluate the final graph output for each example input.\\n\\u200bDefine a graph\\nLets construct a simple ReACT agent to start:\\nCopyfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, TypedDict\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # Messages have the type \"list\". The \\'add_messages\\' function\\n    # in the annotation defines how this state key should be updated\\n    # (in this case, it appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them)\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n# Define the tools for the agent to use\\n@tool\\ndef search(query: str) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Call to surf the web.\"\"\"\\n    # This is a placeholder, but don\\'t tell the LLM that...\\n    if \"sf\" in query.lower() or \"san francisco\" in query.lower():\\n        return \"It\\'s 60 degrees and foggy.\"\\n    return \"It\\'s 90 degrees and sunny.\"\\n\\ntools = [search]\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools)\\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\").bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not\\ndef should_continue(state: State) -> Literal[\"tools\", END]:\\n    messages = state[\\'messages\\']\\n    last_message = messages[-1]\\n    # If the LLM makes a tool call, then we route to the \"tools\" node\\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\\n        return \"tools\"\\n    # Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)\\n    return END\\n\\n# Define the function that calls the model\\ndef call_model(state: State):\\n    messages = state[\\'messages\\']\\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\\n    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list\\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\\n\\n# Define a new graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n# Define the two nodes we will cycle between\\nworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\n# Set the entrypoint as \\'agent\\'\\n# This means that this node is the first one called\\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\")\\n\\n# We now add a conditional edge\\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\\n    # First, we define the start node. We use \\'agent\\'.\\n    # This means these are the edges taken after the \\'agent\\' node is called.\\n    \"agent\",\\n    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.\\n    should_continue,\\n)\\n\\n# We now add a normal edge from \\'tools\\' to \\'agent\\'.\\n# This means that after \\'tools\\' is called, \\'agent\\' node is called next.\\nworkflow.add_edge(\"tools\", \\'agent\\')\\n\\n# Finally, we compile it!\\n# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,\\n# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable.\\n# Note that we\\'re (optionally) passing the memory when compiling the graph\\napp = workflow.compile()\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset\\nLet’s create a simple dataset of questions and expected responses:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nquestions = [\\n    \"what\\'s the weather in sf\",\\n    \"whats the weather in san fran\",\\n    \"whats the weather in tangier\"\\n]\\n\\nanswers = [\\n    \"It\\'s 60 degrees and foggy.\",\\n    \"It\\'s 60 degrees and foggy.\",\\n    \"It\\'s 90 degrees and sunny.\",\\n]\\n\\nls_client = Client()\\ndataset = ls_client.create_dataset(\\n    \"weather agent\",\\n    inputs=[{\"question\": q} for q in questions],\\n    outputs=[{\"answers\": a} for a in answers],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCreate an evaluator\\nAnd a simple evaluator:\\nRequires langsmith>=0.2.0\\nCopyjudge_llm = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o\")\\n\\nasync def correct(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    instructions = (\\n        \"Given an actual answer and an expected answer, determine whether\"\\n        \" the actual answer contains all of the information in the\"\\n        \" expected answer. Respond with \\'CORRECT\\' if the actual answer\"\\n        \" does contain all of the expected information and \\'INCORRECT\\'\"\\n        \" otherwise. Do not include anything else in your response.\"\\n    )\\n    # Our graph outputs a State dictionary, which in this case means\\n    # we\\'ll have a \\'messages\\' key and the final message should\\n    # be our actual answer.\\n    actual_answer = outputs[\"messages\"][-1].content\\n    expected_answer = reference_outputs[\"answer\"]\\n    user_msg = (\\n        f\"ACTUAL ANSWER: {actual_answer}\"\\n        f\"\\\\n\\\\nEXPECTED ANSWER: {expected_answer}\"\\n    )\\n    response = await judge_llm.ainvoke(\\n        [\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_msg}\\n        ]\\n    )\\n    return response.content.upper() == \"CORRECT\"\\n\\n\\u200bRun evaluations\\nNow we can run our evaluations and explore the results. We’ll just need to wrap our graph function so that it can take inputs in the format they’re stored on our example:\\nIf all of your graph nodes are defined as sync functions then you can use evaluate or aevaluate. If any of you nodes are defined as async, you’ll need to use aevaluate\\nRequires langsmith>=0.2.0\\nCopyfrom langsmith import aevaluate\\n\\ndef example_to_state(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n  return {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": inputs[\\'question\\']}]}\\n\\n# We use LCEL declarative syntax here.\\n# Remember that langgraph graphs are also langchain runnables.\\ntarget = example_to_state | app\\n\\nexperiment_results = await aevaluate(\\n    target,\\n    data=\"weather agent\",\\n    evaluators=[correct],\\n    max_concurrency=4,  # optional\\n    experiment_prefix=\"claude-3.5-baseline\",  # optional\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bEvaluating intermediate steps\\nOften it is valuable to evaluate not only the final output of an agent but also the intermediate steps it has taken. What’s nice about langgraph is that the output of a graph is a state object that often already carries information about the intermediate steps taken. Usually we can evaluate whatever we’re interested in just by looking at the messages in our state. For example, we can look at the messages to assert that the model invoked the ‘search’ tool upon as a first step.\\nRequires langsmith>=0.2.0\\nCopydef right_tool(outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    tool_calls = outputs[\"messages\"][1].tool_calls\\n    return bool(tool_calls and tool_calls[0][\"name\"] == \"search\")\\n\\nexperiment_results = await aevaluate(\\n    target,\\n    data=\"weather agent\",\\n    evaluators=[correct, right_tool],\\n    max_concurrency=4,  # optional\\n    experiment_prefix=\"claude-3.5-baseline\",  # optional\\n)\\n\\nIf we need access to information about intermediate steps that isn’t in state, we can look at the Run object. This contains the full traces for all node inputs and outputs:\\nSee more about what arguments you can pass to custom evaluators in this how-to guide.\\nCopyfrom langsmith.schemas import Run, Example\\n\\ndef right_tool_from_run(run: Run, example: Example) -> dict:\\n    # Get documents and answer\\n    first_model_run = next(run for run in root_run.child_runs if run.name == \"agent\")\\n    tool_calls = first_model_run.outputs[\"messages\"][-1].tool_calls\\n    right_tool = bool(tool_calls and tool_calls[0][\"name\"] == \"search\")\\n    return {\"key\": \"right_tool\", \"value\": right_tool}\\n\\nexperiment_results = await aevaluate(\\n    target,\\n    data=\"weather agent\",\\n    evaluators=[correct, right_tool_from_run],\\n    max_concurrency=4,  # optional\\n    experiment_prefix=\"claude-3.5-baseline\",  # optional\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bRunning and evaluating individual nodes\\nSometimes you want to evaluate a single node directly to save time and costs. langgraph makes it easy to do this. In this case we can even continue using the evaluators we’ve been using.\\nCopynode_target = example_to_state | app.nodes[\"agent\"]\\n\\nnode_experiment_results = await aevaluate(\\n    node_target,\\n    data=\"weather agent\",\\n    evaluators=[right_tool_from_run],\\n    max_concurrency=4,  # optional\\n    experiment_prefix=\"claude-3.5-model-node\",  # optional\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bRelated\\n\\nlanggraph evaluation docs\\n\\n\\u200bReference code\\nClick to see a consolidated code snippetCopyfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, TypedDict\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langsmith import Client, aevaluate\\n\\n# Define a graph\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # Messages have the type \"list\".

To aid with variable mapping, an example (or run) is provided for reference. Click on the the variables in your prompt and use the dropdown to map them to the relevant parts of the input, output, or reference output.\\nTo add prompt variables type the variable with double curly brackets {{prompt_var}} if using mustache formatting (the default) or single curly brackets {prompt_var} if using f-string formatting.\\nYou may remove variables as needed. For example if you are evaluating a metric such as conciseness, you typically don’t need a reference output so you may remove that variable.\\n\\u200bPreview\\nPreviewing the prompt will show you of what the formatted prompt will look like using the reference run and dataset example shown on the right.\\n\\u200bImprove your evaluator with few-shot examples\\nTo better align the LLM-as-a-judge evaluator to human preferences, LangSmith allows you to collect human corrections on evaluator scores. With this selection enabled, corrections are then inserted automatically as few-shot examples into your prompt.\\nLearn how to set up few-shot examples and make corrections.\\n\\u200bFeedback configuration\\nFeedback configuration is the scoring criteria that your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator will use. Think of this as the rubric that your evaluator will grade based on. Scores will be added as feedback to a run or example. Defining feedback for your evaluator:\\n\\n\\nName the feedback key: This is the name that will appear when viewing evaluation results. Names should be unique across experiments.\\n\\n\\nAdd a description: Describe what the feedback represents.\\n\\n\\nChoose a feedback type:\\n\\n\\n\\nBoolean: True/false feedback.\\nCategorical: Select from predefined categories.\\nContinuous: Numerical scoring within a specified range.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, feedback configuration is added as structured output to the LLM-as-a-judge prompt. If you’re using an existing prompt from the hub, you must add an output schema to the prompt before configuring an evaluator to use it. Each top-level key in the output schema will be treated as a separate piece of feedback.\\n\\u200bSave the evaluator\\nOnce your are finished configuring, save your changes.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsCode evaluatorComposite evaluators⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

For example, if you’re quickly iterating on a prompt and want to smoke test it on a few examples, or if you’re validating that your target and evaluator functions are defined correctly, you may not want to record these evaluations.\\nYou can do this by using the LangSmith Python SDK and passing upload_results=False to evaluate() / aevaluate().\\nThis will run you application and evaluators exactly as it always does and return the same output, but nothing will be recorded to LangSmith. This includes not just the experiment results but also the application and evaluator traces.\\n\\u200bExample\\nLet’s take a look at an example:\\nRequires langsmith>=0.2.0.

Datasets are made up of examples, which store inputs, outputs, and optionally, reference outputs.\\nThis page outlines the various methods for creating and managing datasets in the LangSmith UI.\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset and add examples\\nThe following sections explain the different ways you can create a dataset in LangSmith and add examples to it. Depending on your workflow, you can manually curate examples, automatically capture them from tracing, import files, or even generate synthetic data:\\n\\nManually from a tracing project\\nAutomatically from a tracing project\\nFrom examples in an Annotation Queue\\nFrom the Prompt Playground\\nImport a dataset from a CSV or JSONL file\\nCreate a new dataset from the dataset page\\nAdd synthetic examples created by an LLM via the Datasets UI\\n\\n\\u200bManually from a tracing project\\nA common pattern for constructing datasets is to convert notable traces from your application into dataset examples. This approach requires that you have configured tracing to LangSmith.\\nA technique to build datasets is to filter the most interesting traces, such as traces that were tagged with poor user feedback, and add them to a dataset. For tips on how to filter traces, refer to Filter traces guide.\\nThere are two ways to add data manually from a tracing project to datasets. Navigate to Tracing Projects and select a project.\\n\\n\\nMulti-select runs from the runs table. On the Runs tab, multi-select runs. At the bottom of the page, click  Add to Dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the Runs tab, select a run from the table. On the individual run details page, select  Add to -> Dataset in the top right corner.\\n\\nWhen you select a dataset from the run details page, a modal will pop up letting you know if any transformations were applied or if schema validation failed. For example, the screenshot below shows a dataset that is using transformations to optimize for collecting LLM runs.\\n\\nYou can then optionally edit the run before adding it to the dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bAutomatically from a tracing project\\nYou can use run rules to automatically add traces to a dataset based on certain conditions. For example, you could add all traces that are tagged with a specific use case or have a low feedback score.\\n\\u200bFrom examples in an Annotation Queue\\nIf you rely on subject matter experts to build meaningful datasets, use annotation queues to provide a streamlined view for reviewers. Human reviewers can optionally modify the inputs/outputs/reference outputs from a trace before it is added to the dataset.\\nAnnotation queues can be optionally configured with a default dataset, though you can add runs to any dataset by using the dataset switcher on the bottom of the screen. Once you select the right dataset, click Add to Dataset or hit the hot key D to add the run to it.\\nAny modifications you make to the run in your annotation queue will carry over to the dataset, and all metadata associated with the run will also be copied.\\n\\nNote you can also set up rules to add runs that meet specific criteria to an annotation queue using automation rules.\\n\\u200bFrom the Prompt Playground\\nOn the Prompt Playground page, select Set up Evaluation, click +New if you’re starting a new dataset or select from an existing dataset.\\nCreating datasets inline in the playground is not supported for datasets that have nested keys. In order to add/edit examples with nested keys, you must edit from the datasets page.\\nTo edit the examples:\\n\\nUse +Row to add a new example to the dataset\\nDelete an example using the ⋮ dropdown on the right hand side of the table\\nIf you’re creating a reference-free dataset remove the “Reference Output” column using the x button in the column. Note: this action is not reversible.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bImport a dataset from a CSV or JSONL file\\nOn the Datasets & Experiments page, click +New Dataset, then Import an existing dataset from CSV or JSONL file.\\n\\u200bCreate a new dataset from the Datasets & Experiments page\\n\\nNavigate to the Datasets & Experiments page from the left-hand menu.\\nClick + New Dataset.\\nOn the New Dataset page, select the Create from scratch tab.\\nAdd a name and description for the dataset.\\n(Optional) Create a dataset schema to validate your dataset.\\nClick Create, which will create an empty dataset.\\nTo add examples inline, on the dataset’s page, go to the Examples tab. Click + Example.\\nDefine examples in JSON and click Submit. For more details on dataset splits, refer to Create and manage dataset splits.\\n\\n\\u200bAdd synthetic examples created by an LLM\\nIf you have existing examples and a schema defined on your dataset, when you click + Example there is an option to  Add AI-Generated Examples. This will use an LLM to create synthetic examples.\\nIn Generate examples, do the following:\\n\\n\\nClick API Key in the top right of the pane to set your OpenAI API key as a workspace secret. If your workspace already has an OpenAI API key set, you can skip this step.\\n\\n\\nSelect few-shot examples: Toggle Automatic or Manual reference examples. You can select these examples manually from your dataset or use the automatic selection option.\\n\\n\\nEnter the number of synthetic examples you want to generate.\\n\\n\\nClick Generate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe examples will appear on the Select generated examples page. Choose which examples to add to your dataset, with the option to edit them before finalizing. Click Save Examples.\\n\\n\\nEach example will be validated against your specified dataset schema and tagged as synthetic in the source metadata.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bManage a dataset\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset schema\\nLangSmith datasets store arbitrary JSON objects. We recommend (but do not require) that you define a schema for your dataset to ensure that they conform to a specific JSON schema. Dataset schemas are defined with standard JSON schema, with the addition of a few prebuilt types that make it easier to type common primitives like messages and tools.\\nCertain fields in your schema have a + Transformations option. Transformations are preprocessing steps that, if enabled, update your examples when you add them to the dataset. For example the convert to OpenAI messages transformation will convert message-like objects, like LangChain messages, to OpenAI message format.\\nFor the full list of available transformations, see our reference.\\nIf you plan to collect production traces in your dataset from LangChain ChatModels or from OpenAI calls using the LangSmith OpenAI wrapper, we offer a prebuilt Chat Model schema that converts messages and tools into industry standard openai formats that can be used downstream with any model for testing. You can also customize the template settings to match your use case.Please see the dataset transformations reference for more information.\\n\\u200bCreate and manage dataset splits\\nDataset splits are divisions of your dataset that you can use to segment your data. For example, it is common in machine learning workflows to split datasets into training, validation, and test sets. This can be useful to prevent overfitting - where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. In evaluation workflows, it can be useful to do this when you have a dataset with multiple categories that you may want to evaluate separately; or if you are testing a new use case that you may want to include in your dataset in the future, but want to keep separate for now. Note that the same effect can be achieved manually via metadata - but we expect splits to be used for higher level organization of your dataset to split it into separate groups for evaluation, whereas metadata would be used more for storing information on your examples like tags and information about its origin.\\nIn machine learning, it is best practice to keep your splits separate (each example belongs to exactly one split). However, we allow you to select multiple splits for the same example in LangSmith because it can make sense for some evaluation workflows - for example, if an example falls into multiple categories on which you may want to evaluate your application.\\nIn order to create and manage splits in the app, you can select some examples in your dataset and click “Add to Split”. From the resulting popup menu, you can select and unselect splits for the selected examples, or create a new split.\\n\\n\\u200bEdit example metadata\\nYou can add metadata to your examples by clicking on an example and then clicking “Edit” on the top righthand side of the popover. From this page, you can update/delete existing metadata, or add new metadata. You may use this to store information about your examples, such as tags or version info, which you can then group by when analyzing experiment results or filter by when you call list_examples in the SDK.\\n\\n\\u200bFilter examples\\nYou can filter examples by split, metadata key/value or perform full-text search over examples. These filtering options are available to the top left of the examples table.\\n\\nFilter by split: Select split > Select a split to filter by\\nFilter by metadata: Filters > Select “Metadata” from the dropdown > Select the metadata key and value to filter on\\nFull-text search: Filters > Select “Full Text” from the dropdown > Enter your search criteria\\n\\nYou may add multiple filters, and only examples that satisfy all of the filters will be displayed in the table.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsEvaluation approachesWith the SDK⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This includes creating, updating, and deleting datasets, as well as adding examples to them.\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset from list of values\\nThe most flexible way to make a dataset using the client is by creating examples from a list of inputs and optional outputs. Below is an example.\\nNote that you can add arbitrary metadata to each example, such as a note or a source. The metadata is stored as a dictionary.\\nIf you have many examples to create, consider using the create_examples/createExamples method to create multiple examples in a single request. If creating a single example, you can use the create_example/createExample method.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nexamples = [\\n  {\\n    \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is the largest mammal?\"},\\n    \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"The blue whale\"},\\n    \"metadata\": {\"source\": \"Wikipedia\"},\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What do mammals and birds have in common?\"},\\n    \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"They are both warm-blooded\"},\\n    \"metadata\": {\"source\": \"Wikipedia\"},\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What are reptiles known for?\"},\\n    \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"Having scales\"},\\n    \"metadata\": {\"source\": \"Wikipedia\"},\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What\\'s the main characteristic of amphibians?\"},\\n    \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"They live both in water and on land\"},\\n    \"metadata\": {\"source\": \"Wikipedia\"},\\n  },\\n]\\n\\nclient = Client()\\ndataset_name = \"Elementary Animal Questions\"\\n\\n# Storing inputs in a dataset lets us\\n# run chains and LLMs over a shared set of examples.\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(\\n  dataset_name=dataset_name, description=\"Questions and answers about animal phylogenetics.\",\\n)\\n\\n# Prepare inputs, outputs, and metadata for bulk creation\\nclient.create_examples(\\n  dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n  examples=examples\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset from traces\\nTo create datasets from the runs (spans) of your traces, you can use the same approach. For many more examples of how to fetch and filter runs, see the export traces guide. Below is an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nclient = Client()\\ndataset_name = \"Example Dataset\"\\n\\n# Filter runs to add to the dataset\\nruns = client.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"my_project\",\\n  is_root=True,\\n  error=False,\\n)\\n\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name, description=\"An example dataset\")\\n\\n# Prepare inputs and outputs for bulk creation\\nexamples = [{\"inputs\": run.inputs, \"outputs\": run.outputs} for run in runs]\\n\\n# Use the bulk create_examples method\\nclient.create_examples(\\n  dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n  examples=examples\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset from a CSV file\\nIn this section, we will demonstrate how you can create a dataset by uploading a CSV file.\\nFirst, ensure your CSV file is properly formatted with columns that represent your input and output keys.

When evaluating the performance of such applications, core concepts such as building a dataset and defining evaluators and metrics to judge your app outputs remain useful. However, you may also find it useful to run a simulation between your app and a user, then evaluate this dynamically created trajectory.\\nSome advantages of doing this are:\\n\\nEase of getting started vs. an evaluation over a full dataset of pre-existing trajectories\\nEnd-to-end coverage from an initial query until a successful or unsuccessful resolution\\nThe ability to detect repetitive behavior or context loss over several iterations of your app\\n\\nThe downside is that because you are broadening your evaluation surface area to contain multiple turns, there is less consistency than evaluating a single output from your app given a static input from a dataset.\\n\\nThis guide will show you how to simulate multi-turn interactions and evaluate them using the open-source openevals package, which contains prebuilt evaluators and other convenient resources for evaluating your AI apps. It will also use OpenAI models, though you can use other providers as well.\\n\\u200bSetup\\nFirst, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopypip install -U langsmith openevals\\n\\nIf you are using yarn as your package manager, you will also need to manually install @langchain/core as a peer dependency of openevals. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general.\\nAnd set up your environment variables:\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"<Your LangSmith API key>\"\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<Your OpenAI API key>\"\\n\\n\\u200bRunning a simulation\\nThere are two primary components you’ll need to get started:\\n\\napp: Your application, or a function wrapping it. Must accept a single chat message (dict with “role” and “content” keys) as an input arg and a thread_id as a kwarg. Should accept other kwargs as more may be added in future releases. Returns a chat message as output with at least role and content keys.\\nuser: The simulated user. In this guide, we will use an imported prebuilt function named create_llm_simulated_user which uses an LLM to generate user responses, though you can create your own too.\\n\\nThe simulator in openevals passes a single chat message to your app from the user for each turn. Therefore you should statefully track the current history internally based on thread_id if needed.\\nHere’s an example that simulates a multi-turn customer support interaction. This guide uses a simple chat app that wraps a single call to the OpenAI chat completions API, however this is where you would call your application or agent. In this example, our simulated user is playing the role of a particularly aggressive customer:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom openevals.simulators import run_multiturn_simulation, create_llm_simulated_user\\nfrom openevals.types import ChatCompletionMessage\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\n# Wrap OpenAI client for tracing\\nclient = wrap_openai(OpenAI())\\nhistory = {}\\n\\n# Your application logic\\ndef app(inputs: ChatCompletionMessage, *, thread_id: str, **kwargs):\\n    if thread_id not in history:\\n        history[thread_id] = []\\n    history[thread_id].append(inputs)\\n    # inputs is a message object with role and content\\n    res = client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\\n        messages=[\\n            {\\n                \"role\": \"system\",\\n                \"content\": \"You are a patient and understanding customer service agent.\",\\n            },\\n        ] + history[thread_id],\\n    )\\n    response_message = res.choices[0].message\\n    history[thread_id].append(response_message)\\n    return response_message\\n\\nuser = create_llm_simulated_user(\\n    system=\"You are an aggressive and hostile customer who wants a refund for their car.\",\\n    model=\"openai:gpt-4.1-mini\",\\n)\\n\\n# Run the simulation directly with the new function\\nsimulator_result = run_multiturn_simulation(\\n    app=app,\\n    user=user,\\n    max_turns=5,\\n)\\nprint(simulator_result)\\n\\nThe response looks like this:\\nCopy{\\n  \"trajectory\": [\\n    {\\n      \"role\": \"user\",\\n      \"content\": \"This piece of junk car is a complete disaster! I demand a full refund immediately. How dare you sell me such a worthless vehicle!\",\\n      \"id\": \"chatcmpl-BUpXa07LaM7wXbyaNnng1Gtn5Dsbh\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n      \"content\": \"I\\'m really sorry to hear about your experience and understand how frustrating this must be. I\\'d like to help resolve this issue as smoothly as possible. Could you please provide some details about the problem with the vehicle?

Your patience is greatly appreciated, and I am committed to resolving this matter to your satisfaction.\",\\n      \"refusal\": null,\\n      \"annotations\": [],\\n      \"id\": \"a0536d4f-9353-4cfa-84df-51c8d29e076d\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nThe simulation first generates an initial query from the simulated user, then passes response chat messages back and forth until it reaches max_turns (you can alternatively pass a stopping_condition that takes the current trajectory and returns True or False - see the OpenEvals README for more information). The return value is the final list of chat messages that make up the converation’s trajectory.\\nThere are several ways to configure the simulated user, such as having it return fixed responses for the first turns of your simulation, as well as the simulation as a whole. For full details, check out the OpenEvals README.\\nThe final trace will look something like this with responses from your app and user interleaved:\\n\\nCongrats! You just ran your first multi-turn simulation. Next, we’ll cover how to run it in a LangSmith experiment.\\n\\u200bRunning in LangSmith experiments\\nYou can use the results of multi-turn simulations as part of a LangSmith experiment to track performance and progress over time. For these sections, it helps to be familiar with at least one of LangSmith’s pytest (Python-only), Vitest/Jest (JS only), or evaluate runners.\\n\\u200bUsing pytest or Vitest/Jest\\nSee the following guides to learn how to set up evals using LangSmith’s integrations with test frameworks:\\npytest\\nVitest or Jest\\n\\nIf you are using one of the LangSmith test framework integrations, you can pass in an array of OpenEvals evaluators as a trajectory_evaluators param when running the simulation. These evaluators will run at the end of the simulation, taking the final list of chat messages as an outputs kwarg. Your passed trajectory_evaluator must therefore accept this kwarg.\\n\\nHere’s an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom openevals.simulators import run_multiturn_simulation, create_llm_simulated_user\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.types import ChatCompletionMessage\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport pytest\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_multiturn_message_with_openai():\\n    inputs = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I want a refund for my car!\"}\\n    t.log_inputs(inputs)\\n    # Wrap OpenAI client for tracing\\n    client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())\\n    history = {}\\n\\n    def app(inputs: ChatCompletionMessage, *, thread_id: str):\\n        if thread_id not in history:\\n            history[thread_id] = []\\n        history[thread_id] = history[thread_id] + [inputs]\\n        res = client.chat.completions.create(\\n            model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\",\\n            messages=[\\n                {\\n                    \"role\": \"system\",\\n                    \"content\": \"You are a patient and understanding customer service agent.\",\\n                }\\n            ]\\n            + history[thread_id],\\n        )\\n        response = res.choices[0].message\\n        history[thread_id].append(response)\\n        return response\\n\\n    user = create_llm_simulated_user(\\n        system=\"You are a nice customer who wants a refund for their car.\",\\n        model=\"openai:gpt-4.1-nano\",\\n        fixed_responses=[\\n            inputs,\\n        ],\\n    )\\n    trajectory_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n        model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n        prompt=\"Based on the below conversation, was the user satisfied?\\\\n{outputs}\",\\n        feedback_key=\"satisfaction\",\\n    )\\n    res = run_multiturn_simulation(\\n        app=app,\\n        user=user,\\n        trajectory_evaluators=[trajectory_evaluator],\\n        max_turns=5,\\n    )\\n    t.log_outputs(res)\\n    # Optionally, assert that the evaluator scored the interaction as satisfactory.\\n    # This will cause the overall test case to fail if \"score\" is False.\\n    assert res[\"evaluator_results\"][0][\"score\"]\\n\\nLangSmith will automatically detect and log the feedback returned from the passed trajectory_evaluators, adding it to the experiment. Note also that the test case uses the fixed_responses param on the simulated user to start the conversation with a specific input, which you can log and make part of your stored dataset.\\nYou may also find it convenient to have the simulated user’s system prompt to be part of your logged dataset as well.\\n\\u200bUsing evaluate\\nYou can also use the evaluate runner to evaluate simulated multi-turn interactions. This will be a little bit different from the pytest/Vitest/Jest example in the following ways:\\n\\nThe simulation should be part of your target function, and your target function should return the final trajectory.\\n\\nThis will make the trajectory the outputs that LangSmith will pass to your evaluators.\\n\\n\\nInstead of using the trajectory_evaluators param, you should pass your evaluators as a param into the evaluate() method.\\nYou will need an existing dataset of inputs and (optionally) reference trajectories.\\n\\nHere’s an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom openevals.simulators import run_multiturn_simulation, create_llm_simulated_user\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.types import ChatCompletionMessage\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\nls_client = Client()\\nexamples = [\\n    {\\n        \"inputs\": {\\n            \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I want a refund for my car!\" }]\\n        },\\n    },\\n]\\ndataset = ls_client.create_dataset(dataset_name=\"multiturn-starter\")\\nls_client.create_examples(\\n    dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n    examples=examples,\\n)\\ntrajectory_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n    model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n    prompt=\"Based on the below conversation, was the user satisfied?\\\\n{outputs}\",\\n    feedback_key=\"satisfaction\",\\n)\\n\\ndef target(inputs: dict):\\n    # Wrap OpenAI client for tracing\\n    client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())\\n    history = {}\\n\\n    def app(next_message: ChatCompletionMessage, *, thread_id: str):\\n        if thread_id not in history:\\n            history[thread_id] = []\\n        history[thread_id] = history[thread_id] + [next_message]\\n        res = client.chat.completions.create(\\n            model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\",\\n            messages=[\\n                {\\n                    \"role\": \"system\",\\n                    \"content\": \"You are a patient and understanding customer service agent.\",\\n                }\\n            ]\\n            + history[thread_id],\\n        )\\n        response = res.choices[0].message\\n        history[thread_id].append(response)\\n        return response\\n\\n    user = create_llm_simulated_user(\\n        system=\"You are a nice customer who wants a refund for their car.\",\\n        model=\"openai:gpt-4.1-nano\",\\n        fixed_responses=inputs[\"messages\"],\\n    )\\n    res = run_multiturn_simulation(\\n        app=app,\\n        user=user,\\n        max_turns=5,\\n    )\\n    return res[\"trajectory\"]\\n\\nresults = ls_client.evaluate(\\n    target,\\n    data=dataset.name,\\n    evaluators=[trajectory_evaluator],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bModifying the simulated user persona\\nThe above examples run using the same simulated user persona for all input examples, defined by the system parameter passed into create_llm_simulated_user.

LangSmith will automatically log the evaluator’s results as feedback.\\nNote that not all evaluators will require each parameter (the exact match evaluator only requires outputs and reference outputs, for example). Additionally, if your LLM-as-a-judge prompt requires additional variables, passing them in as kwargs will format them into the prompt.\\nSet up your test file like this:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport pytest\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.prompts import CORRECTNESS_PROMPT\\n\\ncorrectness_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n    prompt=CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,\\n    feedback_key=\"correctness\",\\n    model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n)\\n\\n# Mock standin for your application\\ndef my_llm_app(inputs: dict) -> str:\\n    return \"Doodads have increased in price by 10% in the past year.\"\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_correctness():\\n    inputs = \"How much has the price of doodads changed in the past year?\"\\n    reference_outputs = \"The price of doodads has decreased by 50% in the past year.\"\\n    outputs = my_llm_app(inputs)\\n\\n    t.log_inputs({\"question\": inputs})\\n    t.log_outputs({\"answer\": outputs})\\n    t.log_reference_outputs({\"answer\": reference_outputs})\\n\\n    correctness_evaluator(\\n        inputs=inputs,\\n        outputs=outputs,\\n        reference_outputs=reference_outputs\\n    )\\n\\nThe feedback_key/feedbackKey parameter will be used as the name of the feedback in your experiment.\\nRunning the eval in your terminal will result in something like the following:\\n\\nYou can also pass prebuilt evaluators directly into the evaluate method if you have already created a dataset in LangSmith. If using Python, this requires langsmith>=0.3.11:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.prompts import CONCISENESS_PROMPT\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nconciseness_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n    prompt=CONCISENESS_PROMPT,\\n    feedback_key=\"conciseness\",\\n    model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n)\\n\\nexperiment_results = client.evaluate(\\n    # This is a dummy target function, replace with your actual LLM-based system\\n    lambda inputs: \"What color is the sky?\",\\n    data=\"Sample dataset\",\\n    evaluators=[\\n        conciseness_evaluator\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\nFor a complete list of available evaluators, see the openevals and agentevals repos.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsWith the UICode evaluator⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Compared to the standard evaluation flow, this is useful when:\\n\\nEach example requires different evaluation logic\\nYou want to assert binary expectations, and both track these assertions in LangSmith and raise assertion errors locally (e.g. in CI pipelines)\\nYou want pytest-like terminal outputs\\nYou already use pytest to test your app and want to add LangSmith tracking\\n\\nThe pytest integration is in beta and is subject to change in upcoming releases.\\nThe JS/TS SDK has an analogous Vitest/Jest integration.\\n\\u200bInstallation\\nThis functionality requires Python SDK version langsmith>=0.3.4.\\nFor extra features like rich terminal outputs and test caching install:\\npipuvCopypip install -U \"langsmith[pytest]\"\\n\\n\\u200bDefine and run tests\\nThe pytest integration lets you define datasets and evaluators as test cases.\\nTo track a test in LangSmith add the @pytest.mark.langsmith decorator. Every decorated test case will be synced to a dataset example. When you run the test suite, the dataset will be updated and a new experiment will be created with one result for each test case.\\nPythonCopy###################### my_app/main.py ######################\\nimport openai\\nfrom langsmith import traceable, wrappers\\n\\noai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(openai.OpenAI())\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef generate_sql(user_query: str) -> str:\\n    result = oai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Convert the user query to a SQL query.\"},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_query},\\n        ],\\n    )\\n    return result.choices[0].message.content\\n\\n###################### tests/test_my_app.py ######################\\nimport pytest\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\n\\ndef is_valid_sql(query: str) -> bool:\\n    \"\"\"Return True if the query is valid SQL.\"\"\"\\n    return True  # Dummy implementation\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith  # <-- Mark as a LangSmith test case\\ndef test_sql_generation_select_all() -> None:\\n    user_query = \"Get all users from the customers table\"\\n    t.log_inputs({\"user_query\": user_query})  # <-- Log example inputs, optional\\n    expected = \"SELECT * FROM customers;\"\\n    t.log_reference_outputs({\"sql\": expected})  # <-- Log example reference outputs, optional\\n\\n    sql = generate_sql(user_query)\\n    t.log_outputs({\"sql\": sql})  # <-- Log run outputs, optional\\n\\n    t.log_feedback(key=\"valid_sql\", score=is_valid_sql(sql))  # <-- Log feedback, optional\\n    assert sql == expected  # <-- Test pass/fail status automatically logged to LangSmith under \\'pass\\' feedback key\\n\\nWhen you run this test it will have a default pass boolean feedback key based on the test case passing / failing. It will also track any inputs, outputs, and reference (expected) outputs that you log.\\nUse pytest as you normally would to run the tests:\\nCopypytest tests/\\n\\nIn most cases we recommend setting a test suite name:\\nCopyLANGSMITH_TEST_SUITE=\\'SQL app tests\\' pytest tests/\\n\\nEach time you run this test suite, LangSmith:\\n\\ncreates a dataset for each test file.

There’s a few different ways that we can trace the example inputs and reference outputs and the run outputs. The simplest is to use the log_inputs, log_outputs, and log_reference_outputs methods. You can run these any time in a test to update the example and run for that test:\\nCopyimport pytest\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_foo() -> None:\\n    t.log_inputs({\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2})\\n    t.log_reference_outputs({\"foo\": \"bar\"})\\n    t.log_outputs({\"foo\": \"baz\"})\\n    assert True\\n\\nRunning this test will create/update an example with name “test_foo”, inputs {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}, reference outputs {\"foo\": \"bar\"} and trace a run with outputs {\"foo\": \"baz\"}.\\nNOTE: If you run log_inputs, log_outputs, or log_reference_outputs twice, the previous values will be overwritten.\\nAnother way to define example inputs and reference outputs is via pytest fixtures/parametrizations. By default any arguments to your test function will be logged as inputs on the corresponding example. If certain arguments are meant to represet reference outputs, you can specify that they should be logged as such using @pytest.mark.langsmith(output_keys=[\"name_of_ref_output_arg\"]):\\nCopyimport pytest\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef c() -> int:\\n    return 5\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef d() -> int:\\n    return 6\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith(output_keys=[\"d\"])\\ndef test_cd(c: int, d: int) -> None:\\n    result = 2 * c\\n    t.log_outputs({\"d\": result})  # Log run outputs\\n    assert result == d\\n\\nThis will create/sync an example with name “test_cd”, inputs {\"c\": 5} and reference outputs {\"d\": 6}, and run output {\"d\": 10}.\\n\\u200bLog feedback\\nBy default LangSmith collects the pass/fail rate under the pass feedback key for each test case. You can add additional feedback with log_feedback.\\nCopyimport openai\\nimport pytest\\nfrom langsmith import wrappers\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\n\\noai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(openai.OpenAI())\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_offtopic_input() -> None:\\n    user_query = \"whats up\"\\n    t.log_inputs({\"user_query\": user_query})\\n\\n    sql = generate_sql(user_query)\\n    t.log_outputs({\"sql\": sql})\\n\\n    expected = \"Sorry that is not a valid query.\"\\n    t.log_reference_outputs({\"sql\": expected})\\n\\n    # Use this context manager to trace any steps used for generating evaluation\\n    # feedback separately from the main application logic\\n    with t.trace_feedback():\\n        instructions = (\\n            \"Return 1 if the ACTUAL and EXPECTED answers are semantically equivalent, \"\\n            \"otherwise return 0. Return only 0 or 1 and nothing else.\"\\n        )\\n\\n        grade = oai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n            model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n            messages=[\\n                {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions},\\n                {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"ACTUAL: {sql}\\\\nEXPECTED: {expected}\"},\\n            ],\\n        )\\n        score = float(grade.choices[0].message.content)\\n        t.log_feedback(key=\"correct\", score=score)\\n\\n    assert score\\n\\nNote the use of the trace_feedback() context manager. This makes it so that the LLM-as-judge call is traced separately from the rest of the test case. Instead of showing up in the main test case run it will instead show up in the trace for the correct feedback key.\\nNOTE: Make sure that the log_feedback call associated with the feedback trace occurs inside the trace_feedback context. This way we’ll be able to associate the feedback with the trace, and when seeing the feedback in the UI you’ll be able to click on it to see the trace that generated it.\\n\\u200bTrace intermediate calls\\nLangSmith will automatically trace any traceable intermediate calls that happen in the course of test case execution.\\n\\u200bGrouping tests into a test suite\\nBy default, all tests within a given file will be grouped as a single “test suite” with a corresponding dataset. You can configure which test suite a test belongs to by passing the test_suite_name parameter to @pytest.mark.langsmith for case-by-case grouping, or you can set the LANGSMITH_TEST_SUITE env var to group all tests from an execution into a single test suite:\\nCopyLANGSMITH_TEST_SUITE=\"SQL app tests\" pytest tests/\\n\\nWe generally recommend setting LANGSMITH_TEST_SUITE to get a consolidated view of all of your results.\\n\\u200bNaming experiments\\nYou can name an experiment using the LANGSMITH_EXPERIMENT env var:\\nCopyLANGSMITH_TEST_SUITE=\"SQL app tests\" LANGSMITH_EXPERIMENT=\"baseline\" pytest tests/\\n\\n\\u200bCaching\\nLLMs on every commit in CI can get expensive. To save time and resources, LangSmith lets you cache HTTP requests to disk. To enable caching, install with langsmith[pytest] and set an env var: LANGSMITH_TEST_CACHE=/my/cache/path:\\npipuvCopypip install -U \"langsmith[pytest]\"\\nLANGSMITH_TEST_CACHE=tests/cassettes pytest tests/my_llm_tests\\n\\nAll requests will be cached to tests/cassettes and loaded from there on subsequent runs. If you check this in to your repository, your CI will be able to use the cache as well.\\nIn langsmith>=0.4.10, you may selectively enable caching for requests to individual URLs or hostnames like this:\\nCopy@pytest.mark.langsmith(cached_hosts=[\"api.openai.com\", \"https://api.anthropic.com\"])\\ndef my_test():\\n    ...\\n\\n\\u200bpytest features\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith is designed to stay out of your way and works well with familiar pytest features.\\n\\u200bParametrize with pytest.mark.parametrize\\nYou can use the parametrize decorator as before. This will create a new test case for each parametrized instance of the test.\\nCopy@pytest.mark.langsmith(output_keys=[\"expected_sql\"])\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\\n    \"user_query, expected_sql\",\\n    [\\n        (\"Get all users from the customers table\", \"SELECT * FROM customers\"),\\n        (\"Get all users from the orders table\", \"SELECT * FROM orders\"),\\n    ],\\n)\\ndef test_sql_generation_parametrized(user_query, expected_sql):\\n    sql = generate_sql(user_query)\\n    assert sql == expected_sql\\n\\nNote: as the parametrized list grows, you may consider using evaluate() instead. This parallelizes the evaluation and makes it easier to control individual experiments and the corresponding dataset.\\n\\u200bParallelize with pytest-xdist\\nYou can use pytest-xdist as you normally would to parallelize test execution:\\npipuvCopypip install -U pytest-xdist\\npytest -n auto tests\\n\\n\\u200bAsync tests with pytest-asyncio\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith works with sync or async tests, so you can run async tests exactly as before.\\n\\u200bWatch mode with pytest-watch\\nUse watch mode to quickly iterate on your tests. We highly recommend ony using this with test caching (see below) enabled to avoid unnecessary LLM calls:\\npipuvCopypip install pytest-watch\\nLANGSMITH_TEST_CACHE=tests/cassettes ptw tests/my_llm_tests\\n\\n\\u200bRich outputs\\nIf you’d like to see a rich display of the LangSmith results of your test run you can specify --langsmith-output:\\nCopypytest --langsmith-output tests\\n\\nNote: This flag used to be --output=langsmith in langsmith<=0.3.3 but was updated to avoid collisions with other pytest plugins.\\nYou’ll get a nice table per test suite that updates live as the results are uploaded to LangSmith:\\n\\nSome important notes for using this feature:\\n\\nMake sure you’ve installed pip install -U \"langsmith[pytest]\"\\nRich outputs do not currently work with pytest-xdist\\n\\nNOTE: The custom output removes all the standard pytest outputs. If you’re trying to debug some unexpected behavior it’s often better to show the regular pytest outputs so to get full error traces.\\n\\u200bDry-run mode\\nIf you want to run the tests without syncing the results to LangSmith, you can set LANGSMITH_TEST_TRACKING=false in your environment.\\nCopyLANGSMITH_TEST_TRACKING=false pytest tests/\\n\\nThe tests will run as normal, but the experiment logs will not be sent to LangSmith.\\n\\u200bExpectations\\nLangSmith provides an expect utility to help define expectations about your LLM output. For example:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import expect\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_sql_generation_select_all():\\n    user_query = \"Get all users from the customers table\"\\n    sql = generate_sql(user_query)\\n    expect(sql).to_contain(\"customers\")\\n\\nThis will log the binary “expectation” score to the experiment results, additionally asserting that the expectation is met possibly triggering a test failure.\\nexpect also provides “fuzzy match” methods. For example:\\nCopy@pytest.mark.langsmith(output_keys=[\"expectation\"])\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\\n    \"query, expectation\",\\n    [\\n       (\"what\\'s the capital of France?\", \"Paris\"),\\n    ],\\n)\\ndef test_embedding_similarity(query, expectation):\\n    prediction = my_chatbot(query)\\n    expect.embedding_distance(\\n        # This step logs the distance as feedback for this run\\n        prediction=prediction, expectation=expectation\\n        # Adding a matcher (in this case, \\'to_be_*\"), logs \\'expectation\\' feedback\\n    ).to_be_less_than(0.5) # Optional predicate to assert against\\n\\n    expect.edit_distance(\\n        # This computes the normalized Damerau-Levenshtein distance between the two strings\\n        prediction=prediction, expectation=expectation\\n        # If no predicate is provided below, \\'assert\\' isn\\'t called, but the score is still logged\\n    )\\n\\nThis test case will be assigned 4 scores:\\n\\nThe embedding_distance between the prediction and the expectation\\nThe binary expectation score (1 if cosine distance is less than 0.5, 0 if not)\\nThe edit_distance between the prediction and the expectation\\nThe overall test pass/fail score (binary)\\n\\nThe expect utility is modeled off of Jest’s expect API, with some off-the-shelf functionality to make it easier to grade your LLMs.\\n\\u200bLegacy\\n\\u200b@test / @unit decorator\\nThe legacy method for marking test cases is using the @test or @unit decorators:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import test\\n\\n@test\\ndef test_foo() -> None:\\n    pass\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsRun an evaluation asynchronouslyRun evals with Vitest/Jest⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

There are a few ways to deal with rate limits.\\n\\u200bUsing langchain RateLimiters (Python only)\\nIf you’re using langchain Python ChatModels in your application or evaluators, you can add rate limiters to your model(s) that will add client-side control of the frequency with which requests are sent to the model provider API to avoid rate limit errors.\\nCopyfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter\\n\\nrate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(\\n    requests_per_second=0.1,  # <-- Super slow! We can only make a request once every 10 seconds!!\\n    check_every_n_seconds=0.1,  # Wake up every 100 ms to check whether allowed to make a request,\\n    max_bucket_size=10,  # Controls the maximum burst size.\\n)\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o\", rate_limiter=rate_limiter)\\n\\ndef app(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    response = llm.invoke(...)\\n    ...\\n\\ndef evaluator(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    response = llm.invoke(...)\\n    ...\\n\\nSee the langchain documentation for more on how to configure rate limiters.\\n\\u200bRetrying with exponential backoff\\nA very common way to deal with rate limit errors is retrying with exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means repeatedly retrying failed requests with an (exponentially) increasing wait time between each retry. This continues until either the request succeeds or a maximum number of requests is made.\\n\\u200bWith langchain\\nIf you’re using langchain components you can add retries to all model calls with the .with_retry(...) / .withRetry() method:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain import init_chat_model\\n\\nllm_with_retry = init_chat_model(\"gpt-4o-mini\").with_retry(stop_after_attempt=6)\\n\\nSee the langchain Python and JS API references for more.\\n\\u200bWithout langchain\\nIf you’re not using langchain you can use other libraries like tenacity (Python) or backoff (Python) to implement retries with exponential backoff, or you can implement it from scratch. See some examples of how to do this in the OpenAI docs.\\n\\u200bLimiting max_concurrency\\nLimiting the number of concurrent calls you’re making to your application and evaluators is another way to decrease the frequency of model calls you’re making, and in that way avoid rate limit errors. max_concurrency can be set directly on the evaluate() / aevaluate() functions. This parallelizes evaluation by effectively splitting the dataset across threads.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import aevaluate\\n\\nresults = await aevaluate(\\n    ...\\n    max_concurrency=4,\\n)\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsEvaluate with repetitionsRun an evaluation locally (Python)⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Outputs can differ from one repetition to the next. Repetitions are a way to reduce noise in systems prone to high variability, such as agents.\\n\\u200bConfiguring repetitions on an experiment\\nAdd the optional num_repetitions param to the evaluate / aevaluate function (Python, TypeScript) to specify how many times to evaluate over each example in your dataset. For instance, if you have 5 examples in the dataset and set num_repetitions=5, each example will be run 5 times, for a total of 25 runs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import evaluate\\n\\nresults = evaluate(\\n    lambda inputs: label_text(inputs[\"text\"]),\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[correct_label],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"Toxic Queries\",\\n    num_repetitions=3,\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bViewing results of experiments run with repetitions\\nIf you’ve run your experiment with repetitions, there will be arrows in the output results column so you can view outputs in the table. To view each run from the repetition, hover over the output cell and click the expanded view. When you run an experiment with repetitions, LangSmith displays the average for each feedback score in the table.

The SDKs have many optimizations and features that enhance the performance and reliability of your evals. However, if you are unable to use the SDKs, either because you are using a different language or because you are running in a restricted environment, you can use the REST API directly.\\nThis guide will show you how to run evals using the REST API, using the requests library in Python as an example. However, the same principles apply to any language.\\n\\u200b1. Create a target function endpoint\\nHere, we are using the python SDK for convenience.

Your experiments will be grouped together under a single dataset, and you will be able to use the comparison view to compare results between experiments.\\nEnsure that the start and end times of your individual rows are all between the start and end time of your experiment.\\nYou must provide either a dataset_id or a dataset_name. If you only provide an ID and the dataset does not yet exist, we will generate a name for you, and vice versa if you only provide a name.\\nYou may not upload experiments to a dataset that was not created via this endpoint. Uploading experiments is only supported for externally-managed datasets.\\n\\u200bExample request\\nBelow is an example of a simple call to the /datasets/upload-experiment.

For a complete list of prebuilt evaluators with usage examples, refer to the openevals and agentevals repos.\\n\\u200bSetup\\nYou’ll need to install the openevals package to use the pre-built LLM-as-a-judge evaluator.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopypip install -U openevals\\n\\nYou’ll also need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable, though you can choose different providers too:\\nCopyexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_openai_api_key\"\\n\\nWe’ll also use LangSmith’s pytest integration for Python and Vitest/Jest for TypeScript to run our evals. openevals also integrates seamlessly with the evaluate method as well. See the appropriate guides for setup instructions.\\n\\u200bRunning an evaluator\\nThe general flow is simple: import the evaluator or factory function from openevals, then run it within your test file with inputs, outputs, and reference outputs. LangSmith will automatically log the evaluator’s results as feedback.\\nNote that not all evaluators will require each parameter (the exact match evaluator only requires outputs and reference outputs, for example). Additionally, if your LLM-as-a-judge prompt requires additional variables, passing them in as kwargs will format them into the prompt.\\nSet up your test file like this:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport pytest\\nfrom langsmith import testing as t\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.prompts import CORRECTNESS_PROMPT\\n\\ncorrectness_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n    prompt=CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,\\n    feedback_key=\"correctness\",\\n    model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n)\\n\\n# Mock standin for your application\\ndef my_llm_app(inputs: dict) -> str:\\n    return \"Doodads have increased in price by 10% in the past year.\"\\n\\n@pytest.mark.langsmith\\ndef test_correctness():\\n    inputs = \"How much has the price of doodads changed in the past year?\"\\n    reference_outputs = \"The price of doodads has decreased by 50% in the past year.\"\\n    outputs = my_llm_app(inputs)\\n\\n    t.log_inputs({\"question\": inputs})\\n    t.log_outputs({\"answer\": outputs})\\n    t.log_reference_outputs({\"answer\": reference_outputs})\\n\\n    correctness_evaluator(\\n        inputs=inputs,\\n        outputs=outputs,\\n        reference_outputs=reference_outputs\\n    )\\n\\nThe feedback_key/feedbackKey parameter will be used as the name of the feedback in your experiment.\\nRunning the eval in your terminal will result in something like the following:\\n\\nYou can also pass prebuilt evaluators directly into the evaluate method if you have already created a dataset in LangSmith. If using Python, this requires langsmith>=0.3.11:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge\\nfrom openevals.prompts import CONCISENESS_PROMPT\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nconciseness_evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(\\n    prompt=CONCISENESS_PROMPT,\\n    feedback_key=\"conciseness\",\\n    model=\"openai:o3-mini\",\\n)\\n\\nexperiment_results = client.evaluate(\\n    # This is a dummy target function, replace with your actual LLM-based system\\n    lambda inputs: \"What color is the sky?\",\\n    data=\"Sample dataset\",\\n    evaluators=[\\n        conciseness_evaluator\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\nFor a complete list of available evaluators, see the openevals and agentevals repos.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsWith the UICode evaluator⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This page describes dataset operations including:\\n\\nVersioning datasets to track changes over time.\\nFiltering and splitting datasets for evaluation.\\nSharing datasets publicly.\\nExporting datasets in various formats.\\n\\nYou’ll also learn how to export filtered traces from experiments back to datasets for further analysis and iteration.\\n\\u200bVersion a dataset\\nIn LangSmith, datasets are versioned. This means that every time you add, update, or delete examples in your dataset, a new version of the dataset is created.\\n\\u200bCreate a new version of a dataset\\nAny time you add, update, or delete examples in your dataset, a new version of your dataset is created. This allows you to track changes to your dataset over time and understand how your dataset has evolved.\\nBy default, the version is defined by the timestamp of the change. When you click on a particular version of a dataset (by timestamp) in the Examples tab, you will find the state of the dataset at that point in time.\\n\\nNote that examples are read-only when viewing a past version of the dataset. You will also see the operations that were between this version of the dataset and the latest version of the dataset.\\nBy default, the latest version of the dataset is shown in the Examples tab and experiments from all versions are shown in the Tests tab.\\nIn the Tests tab, you will find the results of tests run on the dataset at different versions.\\n\\n\\u200bTag a version\\nYou can also tag versions of your dataset to give them a more human-readable name, which can be useful for marking important milestones in your dataset’s history.\\nFor example, you might tag a version of your dataset as “prod” and use it to run tests against your LLM pipeline.\\nYou can tag a version of your dataset in the UI by clicking on + Tag this version in the Examples tab.\\n\\nYou can also tag versions of your dataset using the SDK. Here’s an example of how to tag a version of a dataset using the Python SDK:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\nclient = Client()\\ninitial_time = datetime(2024, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) # The timestamp of the version you want to tag\\n\\n# You can tag a specific dataset version with a semantic name, like \"prod\"\\nclient.update_dataset_tag(\\n    dataset_name=toxic_dataset_name, as_of=initial_time, tag=\"prod\"\\n)\\n\\nTo run an evaluation on a particular tagged version of a dataset, refer to the Evaluate on a specific dataset version section.\\n\\u200bEvaluate on a specific dataset version\\nYou may find it helpful to refer to the following content before you read this section:\\nVersion a dataset.\\nFetching examples.\\n\\n\\u200bUse list_examples\\nYou can use evaluate / aevaluate to pass in an iterable of examples to evaluate on a particular version of a dataset. Use list_examples / listExamples to fetch examples from a particular version tag using as_of / asOf and pass that into the data argument.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nls_client = Client()\\n\\n# Assumes actual outputs have a \\'class\\' key.\\n# Assumes example outputs have a \\'label\\' key.\\ndef correct(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n  return outputs[\"class\"] == reference_outputs[\"label\"]\\n\\nresults = ls_client.evaluate(\\n    lambda inputs: {\"class\": \"Not toxic\"},\\n    # Pass in filtered data here:\\n    data=ls_client.list_examples(\\n      dataset_name=\"Toxic Queries\",\\n      as_of=\"latest\",  # specify version here\\n    ),\\n    evaluators=[correct],\\n)\\n\\nLearn more about how to fetch views of a dataset on the Create and manage datasets programmatically page.\\n\\u200bEvaluate on a split / filtered view of a dataset\\nYou may find it helpful to refer to the following content before you read this section:\\nFetching examples.\\nCreating and managing dataset splits.\\n\\n\\u200bEvaluate on a filtered view of a dataset\\nYou can use the list_examples / listExamples method to fetch a subset of examples from a dataset to evaluate on.\\nOne common workflow is to fetch examples that have a certain metadata key-value pair.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import evaluate\\n\\nresults = evaluate(\\n    lambda inputs: label_text(inputs[\"text\"]),\\n    data=client.list_examples(dataset_name=dataset_name, metadata={\"desired_key\": \"desired_value\"}),\\n    evaluators=[correct_label],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"Toxic Queries\",\\n)\\n\\nFor more filtering capabilities, refer to this how-to guide.\\n\\u200bEvaluate on a dataset split\\nYou can use the list_examples / listExamples method to evaluate on one or multiple splits of your dataset.

Note that while you can add LangSmith evals alongside your other unit tests (as standard *.test.ts files) using your existing test config files, the below examples will also set up a separate test config file and command to run your evals. It will assume you end your test files with .eval.ts.\\nThis ensures that the custom test reporter and other LangSmith touchpoints do not modify your existing test outputs.\\n\\u200bVitest\\nInstall the required development dependencies if you have not already:\\nyarnnpmpnpmCopyyarn add -D vitest dotenv\\n\\nThe examples below also require openai (and of course langsmith!) as a dependency:\\nyarnnpmpnpmCopyyarn add langsmith openai\\n\\nThen create a separate ls.vitest.config.ts file with the following base config:\\nCopyimport { defineConfig } from \"vitest/config\";\\n\\nexport default defineConfig({\\n  test: {\\n    include: [\"**/*.eval.?(c|m)[jt]s\"],\\n    reporters: [\"langsmith/vitest/reporter\"],\\n    setupFiles: [\"dotenv/config\"],\\n  },\\n});\\n\\n\\ninclude ensures that only files ending with some variation of eval.ts in your project are run\\nreporters is responsible for nicely formatting your output as shown above\\nsetupFiles runs dotenv to load environment variables before running your evals\\n\\nJSDom environments are not supported at this time. You should either omit the \"environment\" field from your config or set it to \"node\".\\nFinally, add the following to the scripts field in your package.json to run Vitest with the config you just created:\\nCopy{\\n  \"name\": \"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\",\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n    \"eval\": \"vitest run --config ls.vitest.config.ts\"\\n  },\\n  \"dependencies\": {\\n    ...\\n  },\\n  \"devDependencies\": {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nNote that the above script disables Vitest’s default watch mode for running evals since many evaluators may include longer running LLM calls.\\n\\u200bJest\\nInstall the required development dependencies if you have not already:\\nyarnnpmpnpmCopyyarn add -D jest dotenv\\n\\nThe examples below also require openai (and of course langsmith!) as a dependency:\\nyarnnpmpnpmCopyyarn add langsmith openai\\n\\nThe setup instructions below are for basic JS files and CJS. To add support for TypeScript and ESM, see Jest’s official docs or use Vitest.\\nThen create a separate config file named ls.jest.config.cjs:\\nCopymodule.exports = {\\n  testMatch: [\"**/*.eval.?(c|m)[jt]s\"],\\n  reporters: [\"langsmith/jest/reporter\"],\\n  setupFiles: [\"dotenv/config\"],\\n};\\n\\n\\ntestMatch ensures that only files ending with some variation of eval.js in your project are run\\nreporters is responsible for nicely formatting your output as shown above\\nsetupFiles runs dotenv to load environment variables before running your evals\\n\\nJSDom environments are not supported at this time. You should either omit the \"testEnvironment\" field from your config or set it to \"node\".\\nFinally, add the following to the scripts field in your package.json to run Jest with the config you just created:\\nCopy{\\n  \"name\": \"YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\",\\n  \"scripts\": {\\n    \"eval\": \"jest --config ls.jest.config.cjs\"\\n  },\\n  \"dependencies\": {\\n    ...\\n  },\\n  \"devDependencies\": {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n\\u200bDefine and run evals\\nYou can now define evals as tests using familiar Vitest/Jest syntax, with a few caveats:\\n\\nYou should import describe and test from the langsmith/jest or langsmith/vitest entrypoint\\nYou must wrap your test cases in a describe block\\nWhen declaring tests, the signature is slightly different - there is an extra argument containing example inputs and expected outputs\\n\\nTry it out by creating a file named sql.eval.ts (or sql.eval.js if you are using Jest without TypeScript) and pasting the below contents into it:\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\nimport { expect } from \"vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\n// import { expect } from \"@jest/globals\";\\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { wrapOpenAI } from \"langsmith/wrappers/openai\";\\n\\n// Add \"openai\" as a dependency and set OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable\\nconst tracedClient = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());\\n\\nconst generateSql = traceable(\\n  async (userQuery: string) => {\\n    const result = await tracedClient.chat.completions.create({\\n      model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n      messages: [\\n        {\\n          role: \"system\",\\n          content:\\n            \"Convert the user query to a SQL query. Do not wrap in any markdown tags.\",\\n        },\\n        {\\n          role: \"user\",\\n          content: userQuery,\\n        },\\n      ],\\n    });\\n    return result.choices[0].message.content;\\n  },\\n  { name: \"generate_sql\" }\\n);\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"generates select all\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"Get all users from the customers table\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"SELECT * FROM customers;\" },\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      const sql = await generateSql(inputs.userQuery);\\n      ls.logOutputs({ sql }); // <-- Log run outputs, optional\\n      expect(sql).toEqual(referenceOutputs?.sql); // <-- Assertion result logged under \\'pass\\' feedback key\\n    }\\n  );\\n});\\n\\nYou can think of each ls.test() case as corresponding to a dataset example, and ls.describe() as defining a LangSmith dataset. If you have LangSmith tracing environment variables set when you run the test suite, the SDK does the following:\\n\\ncreates a dataset with the same name as the name passed to ls.describe() in LangSmith if it does not exist\\ncreates an example in the dataset for each input and expected output passed into a test case if a matching one does not already exist\\ncreates a new experiment with one result for each test case\\ncollects the pass/fail rate under the pass feedback key for each test case\\n\\nWhen you run this test it will have a default pass boolean feedback key based on the test case passing / failing. It will also track any outputs that you log with the ls.logOutputs() or return from the test function as “actual” result values from your app for the experiment.\\nCreate a .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY and LangSmith credentials if you don’t already have one:\\nCopyOPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_KEY_HERE\"\\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"YOUR_LANGSMITH_KEY\"\\nLANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\\n\\nNow use the eval script we set up in the previous step to run the test:\\nyarnnpmpnpmCopyyarn run eval\\n\\nAnd your declared test should run!\\nOnce it finishes, if you’ve set your LangSmith environment variables, you should see a link directing you to an experiment created in LangSmith alongside the test results.\\nHere’s what an experiment against that test suite looks like:\\n\\n\\u200bTrace feedback\\nBy default LangSmith collects the pass/fail rate under the pass feedback key for each test case. You can add additional feedback with either ls.logFeedback() or wrapEvaluator(). To do so, try the following as your sql.eval.ts file (or sql.eval.js if you are using Jest without TypeScript):\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { wrapOpenAI } from \"langsmith/wrappers/openai\";\\n\\n// Add \"openai\" as a dependency and set OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable\\nconst tracedClient = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());\\n\\nconst generateSql = traceable(\\n  async (userQuery: string) => {\\n    const result = await tracedClient.chat.completions.create({\\n      model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n      messages: [\\n        {\\n          role: \"system\",\\n          content:\\n            \"Convert the user query to a SQL query. Do not wrap in any markdown tags.\",\\n        },\\n        {\\n          role: \"user\",\\n          content: userQuery,\\n        },\\n      ],\\n    });\\n    return result.choices[0].message.content ?? \"\";\\n  },\\n  { name: \"generate_sql\" }\\n);\\n\\nconst myEvaluator = async (params: {\\n  outputs: { sql: string };\\n  referenceOutputs: { sql: string };\\n}) => {\\n  const { outputs, referenceOutputs } = params;\\n  const instructions = [\\n    \"Return 1 if the ACTUAL and EXPECTED answers are semantically equivalent, \",\\n    \"otherwise return 0. Return only 0 or 1 and nothing else.\",\\n  ].join(\"\\\\n\");\\n  const grade = await tracedClient.chat.completions.create({\\n    model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n    messages: [\\n      {\\n        role: \"system\",\\n        content: instructions,\\n      },\\n      {\\n        role: \"user\",\\n        content: `ACTUAL: ${outputs.sql}\\\\nEXPECTED: ${referenceOutputs?.sql}`,\\n      },\\n    ],\\n  });\\n  const score = parseInt(grade.choices[0].message.content ?? \"\");\\n  return { key: \"correctness\", score };\\n};\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"generates select all\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"Get all users from the customers table\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"SELECT * FROM customers;\" },\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      const sql = await generateSql(inputs.userQuery);\\n      ls.logOutputs({ sql });\\n      const wrappedEvaluator = ls.wrapEvaluator(myEvaluator);\\n      // Will automatically log \"correctness\" as feedback\\n      await wrappedEvaluator({\\n        outputs: { sql },\\n        referenceOutputs,\\n      });\\n      // You can also manually log feedback with `ls.logFeedback()`\\n      ls.logFeedback({\\n        key: \"harmfulness\",\\n        score: 0.2,\\n      });\\n    }\\n  );\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"offtopic input\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"whats up\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"sorry that is not a valid query\" },\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      const sql = await generateSql(inputs.userQuery);\\n      ls.logOutputs({ sql });\\n      const wrappedEvaluator = ls.wrapEvaluator(myEvaluator);\\n      // Will automatically log \"correctness\" as feedback\\n      await wrappedEvaluator({\\n        outputs: { sql },\\n        referenceOutputs,\\n      });\\n      // You can also manually log feedback with `ls.logFeedback()`\\n      ls.logFeedback({\\n        key: \"harmfulness\",\\n        score: 0.2,\\n      });\\n    }\\n  );\\n});\\n\\nNote the use of ls.wrapEvaluator() around the myEvaluator function. This makes it so that the LLM-as-judge call is traced separately from the rest of the test case to avoid clutter, and conveniently creates feedback if the return value from the wrapped function matches { key: string; score: number | boolean }. In this case, instead of showing up in the main test case run, the evaluator trace will instead show up in a trace associated with the correctness feedback key.\\nYou can see the evaluator runs in LangSmith by clicking their corresponding feedback chips in the UI.\\n\\u200bRunning multiple examples against a test case\\nYou can run the same test case over multiple examples and parameterize your tests using ls.test.each(). This is useful when you want to evaluate your app the same way against different inputs:\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\n\\nconst DATASET = [\\n  {\\n    inputs: { userQuery: \"whats up\" },\\n    referenceOutputs: { sql: \"sorry that is not a valid query\" }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    inputs: { userQuery: \"what color is the sky?\" },\\n    referenceOutputs: { sql: \"sorry that is not a valid query\" }\\n  },\\n  {\\n    inputs: { userQuery: \"how are you today?\" },\\n    referenceOutputs: { sql: \"sorry that is not a valid query\" }\\n  }\\n];\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test.each(DATASET)(\\n    \"offtopic inputs\",\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      ...\\n    },\\n  );\\n});\\n\\nIf you have tracking enabled, each example in the local dataset will be synced to the one created in LangSmith.\\n\\u200bLog outputs\\nEvery time we run a test we’re syncing it to a dataset example and tracing it as a run. To trace final outputs for the run, you can use ls.logOutputs() like this:\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"offtopic input\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"...\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"...\" }\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      ls.logOutputs({ sql: \"SELECT * FROM users;\" })\\n    },\\n  );\\n});\\n\\nThe logged outputs will appear in your reporter summary and in LangSmith.\\nYou can also directly return a value from your test function:\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"offtopic input\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"...\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"...\" }\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      return { sql: \"SELECT * FROM users;\" }\\n    },\\n  );\\n});\\n\\nHowever keep in mind if you do this that if your test fails to complete due to a failed assertion or other error, your output will not appear.\\n\\u200bTrace intermediate calls\\nLangSmith will automatically trace any traceable intermediate calls that happen in the course of test case execution.\\n\\u200bFocusing or skipping tests\\nYou can chain the Vitest/Jest .skip and .only methods on ls.test() and ls.describe():\\nCopyimport * as ls from \"langsmith/vitest\";\\n// import * as ls from \"langsmith/jest\";\\n\\nls.describe(\"generate sql demo\", () => {\\n  ls.test.skip(\\n    \"offtopic input\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"...\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"...\" }\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      return { sql: \"SELECT * FROM users;\" }\\n    },\\n  );\\n  ls.test.only(\\n    \"other\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { userQuery: \"...\" },\\n      referenceOutputs: { sql: \"...\" }\\n    },\\n    async ({ inputs, referenceOutputs }) => {\\n      return { sql: \"SELECT * FROM users;\" }\\n    },\\n  );\\n});\\n\\n\\u200bConfiguring test suites\\nYou can configure test suites with values like metadata or a custom client by passing an extra argument to ls.describe() for the full suite or by passing a config field into ls.test() for individual tests:\\nCopyls.describe(\"test suite name\", () => {\\n  ls.test(\\n    \"test name\",\\n    {\\n      inputs: { ... },\\n      referenceOutputs: { ... },\\n      // Extra config for the test run\\n      config: { tags: [...], metadata: { ... } }\\n    },\\n    {\\n      name: \"test name\",\\n      tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\\n      skip: true,\\n      only: true,\\n    }\\n  );\\n}, {\\n  testSuiteName: \"overridden value\",\\n  metadata: { ... },\\n  // Custom client\\n  client: new Client(),\\n});\\n\\nThe test suite will also automatically extract environment variables from process.env.ENVIRONMENT, process.env.NODE_ENV and process.env.LANGSMITH_ENVIRONMENT and set them as metadata on created experiments. You can then filter experiments by metadata in LangSmith’s UI.\\nSee the API refs for a full list of configuration options.\\n\\u200bDry-run mode\\nIf you want to run the tests without syncing the results to LangSmith, you can set omit your LangSmith tracing environment variables or set LANGSMITH_TEST_TRACKING=false in your environment.\\nThe tests will run as normal, but the experiment logs will not be sent to LangSmith.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsRun evaluations with pytestWith the API⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Run your evaluationNext stepsVideo guideQuickstartsEvaluation quickstartCopy pageCopy pageEvaluations are a quantitative way to measure performance of LLM applications, which is important because LLMs don’t always behave predictably — small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare changes across different versions of your application, and build more reliable AI applications.\\nEvaluations are made up of three components:\\n\\nA dataset with test inputs and optionally expected outputs.\\nA target function that defines what you’re evaluating. For example, this may be one LLM call that includes the new prompt you are testing, a part of your application or your end to end application.\\nEvaluators that score your target function’s outputs.\\n\\nThis quick start guides you through running a simple evaluation to test the correctness of LLM responses with the LangSmith SDK or UI.\\nThis guide uses prebuilt LLM-as-judge evaluators from the open-source openevals package. OpenEvals includes a set of commonly used evaluators and is a great starting point if you’re new to evaluations. If you want greater flexibility in how you evaluate your apps, you can also define completely custom evaluators using your own code.\\n\\u200bLangSmith SDK\\n\\u200b1. Install dependencies\\nPythonTypeScriptCopypip install -U langsmith openevals openai\\n\\nIf you are using yarn as your package manager, you will also need to manually install @langchain/core as a peer dependency of openevals. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general - you may define evaluators using arbitrary custom code.\\n\\u200b2. Create a LangSmith API key\\nTo create an API key, head to the Settings page. Then click + API Key.\\n\\u200b3. Set up environment variables\\nThis guide uses OpenAI, but you can adapt it to use any LLM provider.\\nIf you’re using Anthropic, use the Anthropic wrapper to trace your calls. For other providers, use the traceable wrapper.\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"<your-langchain-api-key>\"\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<your-openai-api-key>\"\\n\\n\\u200b4. Create a dataset\\nNext, define example input and reference output pairs that you’ll use to evaluate your app:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nclient = Client()\\n\\n# Programmatically create a dataset in LangSmith\\n# For other dataset creation methods, see:\\n# https://docs.smith.langchain.com/langsmith/manage-datasets-programmatically\\n# https://docs.smith.langchain.com/langsmith/manage-datasets-in-application\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(\\n    dataset_name=\"Sample dataset\", description=\"A sample dataset in LangSmith.\"\\n)\\n\\n# Create examples\\nexamples = [\\n    {\\n        \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"Which country is Mount Kilimanjaro located in?\"},\\n        \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania.\"},\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is Earth\\'s lowest point?\"},\\n        \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"Earth\\'s lowest point is The Dead Sea.\"},\\n    },\\n]\\n\\n# Add examples to the dataset\\nclient.create_examples(dataset_id=dataset.id, examples=examples)\\n\\n\\u200b5. Define what you’re evaluating\\nNow, define a target function that contains what you’re evaluating. In this guide, we’ll define a target function that contains a single LLM call to answer a question.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import wrappers\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\n# Wrap the OpenAI client for LangSmith tracing\\nopenai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())\\n\\n# Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function\\n# The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function\\ndef target(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Answer the following question accurately\"},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": inputs[\"question\"]},\\n        ],\\n    )\\n    return { \"answer\": response.choices[0].message.content.strip() }\\n\\n\\u200b6.

Then, we’ll go through the three most effective types of evaluations to run on chat bots:\\n\\nFinal response: Evaluate the agent’s final response.\\nTrajectory: Evaluate whether the agent took the expected path (e.g., of tool calls) to arrive at the final answer.\\nSingle step: Evaluate any agent step in isolation (e.g., whether it selects the appropriate first tool for a given step).\\n\\nWe’ll build our agent using LangGraph, but the techniques and LangSmith functionality shown here are framework-agnostic.\\n\\u200bSetup\\n\\u200bConfigure the environment\\nLet’s install the required dependencies:\\npipuvCopypip install -U langgraph langchain[openai]\\n\\nLet’s set up environment variables for OpenAI and LangSmith:\\nCopyimport getpass\\nimport os\\n\\ndef _set_env(var: str) -> None:\\n    if not os.environ.get(var):\\n        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f\"Set {var}: \")\\n\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"\\n_set_env(\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\")\\n_set_env(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\\n\\n\\u200bDownload the database\\nWe will create a SQLite database for this tutorial. SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use. We will load the chinook database, which is a sample database that represents a digital media store. Find more information about the database here.\\nFor convenience, we have hosted the database in a public GCS bucket:\\nCopyimport requests\\n\\nurl = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db\"\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\n\\nif response.status_code == 200:\\n    # Open a local file in binary write mode\\n    with open(\"chinook.db\", \"wb\") as file:\\n        # Write the content of the response (the file) to the local file\\n        file.write(response.content)\\n    print(\"File downloaded and saved as Chinook.db\")\\nelse:\\n    print(f\"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\\n\\nHere’s a sample of the data in the db:\\nCopyimport sqlite3\\n# ... database connection and query code\\n\\nCopy[(1, \\'AC/DC\\'), (2, \\'Accept\\'), (3, \\'Aerosmith\\'), (4, \\'Alanis Morissette\\'), (5, \\'Alice In Chains\\'), (6, \\'Antônio Carlos Jobim\\'), (7, \\'Apocalyptica\\'), (8, \\'Audioslave\\'), (9, \\'BackBeat\\'), (10, \\'Billy Cobham\\')]\\n\\nAnd here’s the database schema (image from https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database):\\n\\n\\u200bDefine the customer support agent\\nWe’ll create a LangGraph agent with limited access to our database. For demo purposes, our agent will support two basic types of requests:\\n\\nLookup: The customer can look up song titles, artist names, and albums based on other identifying information. For example: “What songs do you have by Jimi Hendrix?”\\nRefund: The customer can request a refund on their past purchases. For example: “My name is Claude Shannon and I’d like a refund on a purchase I made last week, could you help me?”\\n\\nFor simplicity in this demo, we’ll implement refunds by deleting the corresponding database records. We’ll skip implementing user authentication and other production security measures.\\nThe agent’s logic will be structured as two separate subgraphs (one for lookups and one for refunds), with a parent graph that routes requests to the appropriate subgraph.\\n\\u200bRefund agent\\nLet’s build the refund processing agent. This agent needs to:\\n\\nFind the customer’s purchase records in the database\\nDelete the relevant Invoice and InvoiceLine records to process the refund\\n\\nWe’ll create two SQL helper functions:\\n\\nA function to execute the refund by deleting records\\nA function to look up a customer’s purchase history\\n\\nTo make testing easier, we’ll add a “mock” mode to these functions. When mock mode is enabled, the functions will simulate database operations without actually modifying any data.\\nCopyimport sqlite3\\n\\ndef _refund(invoice_id: int | None, invoice_line_ids: list[int] | None, mock: bool = False) -> float:\\n    ...\\n\\ndef _lookup( ...\\n\\nNow let’s define our graph. We’ll use a simple architecture with three main paths:\\n\\n\\nExtract customer and purchase information from the conversation\\n\\n\\nRoute the request to one of three paths:\\n\\nRefund path: If we have sufficient purchase details (Invoice ID or Invoice Line IDs) to process a refund\\nLookup path: If we have enough customer information (name and phone) to search their purchase history\\nResponse path: If we need more information, respond to the user requesting the specific details needed\\n\\n\\n\\nThe graph’s state will track:\\n\\nThe conversation history (messages between user and agent)\\nAll customer and purchase information extracted from the conversation\\nThe next message to send to the user (followup text)\\n\\nCopyfrom typing import Literal\\nimport json\\n\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig\\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\\nfrom typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict\\n\\n# Graph state.\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    \"\"\"Agent state.\"\"\"\\n    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\\n    followup: str | None\\n\\n    invoice_id: int | None\\n    invoice_line_ids: list[int] | None\\n    customer_first_name: str | None\\n    customer_last_name: str | None\\n    customer_phone: str | None\\n    track_name: str | None\\n    album_title: str | None\\n    artist_name: str | None\\n    purchase_date_iso_8601: str | None\\n\\n# Instructions for extracting the user/purchase info from the conversation.\\ngather_info_instructions = \"\"\"You are managing an online music store that sells song tracks. \\\\\\nCustomers can buy multiple tracks at a time and these purchases are recorded in a database as \\\\\\nan Invoice per purchase and an associated set of Invoice Lines for each purchased track.\\n\\nYour task is to help customers who would like a refund for one or more of the tracks they\\'ve \\\\\\npurchased.

We’ll use this configurable variable in our target run_graph method when invoking our graph:\\nCopy# Target function\\nasync def run_graph(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"Run graph and track the trajectory it takes along with the final response.\"\"\"\\n    result = await graph.ainvoke({\"messages\": [\\n        { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": inputs[\\'question\\']},\\n    ]}, config={\"env\": \"test\"})\\n    return {\"response\": result[\"followup\"]}\\n\\n# Evaluation job and results\\nexperiment_results = await client.aevaluate(\\n    run_graph,\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[final_answer_correct],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"sql-agent-gpt4o-e2e\",\\n    num_repetitions=1,\\n    max_concurrency=4,\\n)\\nexperiment_results.to_pandas()\\n\\nYou can see what these results look like here: LangSmith link.\\n\\u200bTrajectory evaluator\\nAs agents become more complex, they have more potential points of failure. Rather than using simple pass/fail evaluations, it’s often better to use evaluations that can give partial credit when an agent takes some correct steps, even if it doesn’t reach the right final answer.\\nThis is where trajectory evaluations come in. A trajectory evaluation:\\n\\nCompares the actual sequence of steps the agent took against an expected sequence\\nCalculates a score based on how many of the expected steps were completed correctly\\n\\nFor this example, our end-to-end dataset contains an ordered list of steps that we expect the agent to take. Let’s create an evaluator that checks the agent’s actual trajectory against these expected steps and calculates what percentage were completed:\\nCopydef trajectory_subsequence(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> float:\\n    \"\"\"Check how many of the desired steps the agent took.\"\"\"\\n    if len(reference_outputs[\\'trajectory\\']) > len(outputs[\\'trajectory\\']):\\n        return False\\n\\n    i = j = 0\\n    while i < len(reference_outputs[\\'trajectory\\']) and j < len(outputs[\\'trajectory\\']):\\n        if reference_outputs[\\'trajectory\\'][i] == outputs[\\'trajectory\\'][j]:\\n            i += 1\\n        j += 1\\n\\n    return i / len(reference_outputs[\\'trajectory\\'])\\n\\nNow we can run our evaluation. Our evaluator assumes that our target function returns a ‘trajectory’ key, so lets define a target function that does so. We’ll need to usage LangGraph’s streaming capabilities to record the trajectory.\\nNote that we are reusing the same dataset as for our final response evaluation, so we could have run both evaluators together and defined a target function that returns both “response” and “trajectory”. In practice it’s often useful to have separate datasets for each type of evaluation, which is why we show them separately here:\\nCopyasync def run_graph(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    \"\"\"Run graph and track the trajectory it takes along with the final response.\"\"\"\\n    trajectory = []\\n    # Set subgraph=True to stream events from subgraphs of the main graph: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-subgraphs/\\n    # Set stream_mode=\"debug\" to stream all possible events: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgra/langsmith/observability-concepts/streaming\\n    async for namespace, chunk in graph.astream({\"messages\": [\\n            {\\n                \"role\": \"user\",\\n                \"content\": inputs[\\'question\\'],\\n            }\\n        ]}, subgraphs=True, stream_mode=\"debug\"):\\n        # Event type for entering a node\\n        if chunk[\\'type\\'] == \\'task\\':\\n            # Record the node name\\n            trajectory.append(chunk[\\'payload\\'][\\'name\\'])\\n            # Given how we defined our dataset, we also need to track when specific tools are\\n            # called by our question answering ReACT agent.

Repeat to improve evaluator alignmentTips for improving evaluator alignmentVideo guideSet up evaluationsImprove evaluatorsImprove LLM-as-judge evaluators using human feedbackCopy pageCopy pageBefore working through this page, it might be helpful to read the following:\\nEvaluation concepts\\nCreating LLM-as-a-judge evaluators\\n\\nReliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluators are critical for making informed decisions about your AI applications (e.g., prompt, model, architecture changes). Defining the evaluator prompt correctly can be difficult, but it directly affects the trustworthiness of your evaluations.\\nThis guide describes how to align your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator using human feedback to improve your evaluator’s quality and help you build reliable AI applications.\\n\\u200bHow it works\\nLangSmith’s Align Evaluator feature has a series of steps that help you align your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator with human expert feedback. You can use this feature to align evaluators that run on a dataset for offline evaluations or for online evaluations. In either case, the steps are similar:\\n\\nSelect experiments or runs that contain outputs from your application.\\nAdd the selected experiments or runs to an annotation queue where a human expert can label the data.\\nTest your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator prompt against the labeled examples. Check the cases where your evaluator result is not aligned with the labeled data. This indicates areas where your evaluator prompt needs improvement.\\nRefine and repeat to improve evaluator alignment. Update your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator prompt and test again.\\n\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nYou’ll need the following before starting this guide for offline evaluations or online evaluations:\\n\\u200bOffline evaluations\\n\\nA dataset with at least one experiment.\\nYou’ll need to upload or create datasets via the SDK or the UI and run an experiment via the SDK or the Playground.\\n\\n\\u200bOnline evaluations\\n\\nAn application that’s already sending traces to LangSmith.\\nConfigure this with one of the tracing integrations to start.\\n\\n\\u200bGetting started\\nYou can enter the alignment flow for both new and existing evaluators in datasets and tracing projects.\\nDataset EvaluatorsTracing Project EvaluatorsCreate an aligned evaluator from scratch1.

Datasets & Experiments > select your dataset > Evaluators tab2. In the Align Evaluator with experiment data box, click Select\\u202fExperiments1. Projects > select your project > Evaluators tab2. In the Align Evaluator with experiment data box, click Select Experiments\\n\\u200b1. Select experiments or runs\\nSelect one or more experiments (or runs) to send for human labeling. This will add runs to an annotation queue.\\n\\nTo add any new experiments/runs to an existing annotation queue, head to the Evaluators tab, select the evaluator you are aligning and click Add to Queue.\\nDatasets should be representative of inputs and outputs you expect to see in production.While you don’t need to cover every possible scenario, it’s important to include examples across the full range of expected use cases. For example, if you’re building a sports bot that answers questions about baseball, basketball, and football, your dataset should include at least one labeled example from each sport.\\n\\u200b2. Label examples\\nLabel examples in the annotation queue by adding a feedback score. Once you’ve labeled an example, click Add to Reference Dataset.\\nIf you have a large number of examples in your experiments, you don’t need to label every example to get started. We recommend starting with at least 20 examples, you can always add more later. We recommend that the examples that you label are diverse (balanced in both 0 and 1 labels) to ensure that you’re building a well rounded evaluator prompt.\\n\\u200b3. Test your evaluator prompt against the labeled examples\\nOnce you have labeled examples, the next step is iterating on your evaluator prompt to mimic the labeled data as well as possible. This iteration is done in the Evaluator Playground.\\nTo go to the evaluator playground: Click the View evaluator button on the top right of the evaluator queue. This will take you to the detail page of the evaluator you are aligning. Click the Evaluator Playground button to access the playground.\\n\\nIn the evaluator playground you can create or edit your evaluator prompt and click Start Alignment to run it over the set of labeled examples that you created in Step 2. After running your evaluator, you’ll see how its generated scores compare to your human labels. The alignment score is the percentage of examples where the evaluator’s judgment matches that of the human expert.\\n\\n\\u200b4. Repeat to improve evaluator alignment\\nIterate by updating your prompt and testing again to improve evaluator alignment.\\nUpdates to your evaluator prompt are not saved by default. We reccomend saving your evaluator prompt regularly, and especially after you see your alignment score improve.The evaluator playground will show the alignment score for the most recently saved version of your evaluator prompt for comparison when you’re iterating on your prompt.\\nImproving the alignment score of your evaluator isn’t an exact science but there are a few strategies that are helpful in increasing the alignment score.\\n\\u200bTips for improving evaluator alignment\\n1. Investigate misaligned examples\\nDigging into misaligned examples and trying to group them into common failure modes is a great first step for improving your evaluator alignment.\\nOnce you have identified the common failure modes, add instructions to your evaluator prompt so the LLM knows about them. For example, you could explain that “MFA stands for “multi-factor authentication” if you notice it not understanding that specific acronym. Or you could tell it that “a good response will always contain at least 3 potential hotels to book” if it is confused on what good/bad means in your evaluator’s context.\\n2. Inspect the reasoning behind the LLM score\\nTo understand why the LLM scored an example the way it did, you can enable reasoning for your LLM-as-a-judge evaluator. Reasoning is helpful to understand the LLM’s thought process and can help you identify common failure modes to incorporate into your evaluator prompt as well..\\nIn order to see the reasoning in the evaluator playground, hover over the LLM score.\\n\\nThis will show the reasoning behind the LLM’s score in the evaluator playground.\\n3. Add more labeled examples and validate performance\\nTo avoid overfitting to the labeled examples, it’s important to add more labeled examples and test performance, especially if you started off with a small number of examples.\\n\\u200bVideo guide\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSimulate multi-turn interactionsImprove your evaluator with few-shot examples⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

After you deploy to production, you’ll want to refine your system by enhancing prompts, language models, tools, and architectures. Backtesting involves assessing new versions of your application using historical data and comparing the new outputs to the original ones. Compared to evaluations using pre-production datasets, backtesting offers a clearer indication of whether the new version of your application is an improvement over the current deployment.\\nHere are the basic steps for backtesting:\\n\\nSelect sample runs from your production tracing project to test against.\\nTransform the run inputs into a dataset and record the run outputs as an initial experiment against that dataset.\\nExecute your new system on the new dataset and compare the results of the experiments.\\n\\nThis process will provide you with a new dataset of representative inputs, which you can version and use for backtesting your models.\\nOften, you won’t have definitive “ground truth” answers available. In such cases, you can manually label the outputs or use evaluators that don’t rely on reference data. If your application allows for capturing ground-truth labels, for example by allowing users to leave feedback, we strongly recommend doing so.\\n\\u200bSetup\\n\\u200bConfigure the environment\\nInstall and set environment variables. This guide requires langsmith>=0.2.4.\\nFor convenience we’ll use the LangChain OSS framework in this tutorial, but the LangSmith functionality shown is framework-agnostic.\\npipuvCopypip install -U langsmith langchain langchain-anthropic langchainhub emoji\\n\\nCopyimport getpass\\nimport os\\n\\n# Set the project name to whichever project you\\'d like to be testing against\\nproject_name = \"Tweet Writing Task\"\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = project_name\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"\\n\\nif not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"):\\n    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"YOUR API KEY\")\\n\\n# Optional.

Then copy over all the traces to serve as a baseline experiment.\\n\\u200bSelect runs to backtest on\\nYou can select the runs to backtest on using the filter argument of list_runs. The filter argument uses the LangSmith trace query syntax to select runs.\\nCopyfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\\nfrom uuid import uuid4\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom langsmith.beta import convert_runs_to_test\\n\\n# Fetch the runs we want to convert to a dataset/experiment\\nclient = Client()\\n\\n# How we are sampling runs to include in our dataset\\nend_time = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)\\nstart_time = end_time - timedelta(days=1)\\nrun_filter = f\\'and(gt(start_time, \"{start_time.isoformat()}\"), lt(end_time, \"{end_time.isoformat()}\"))\\'\\nprod_runs = list(\\n    client.list_runs(\\n        project_name=project_name,\\n        is_root=True,\\n        filter=run_filter,\\n    )\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bConvert runs to experiment\\nconvert_runs_to_test is a function which takes some runs and does the following:\\n\\nThe inputs, and optionally the outputs, are saved to a dataset as Examples.\\nThe inputs and outputs are stored as an experiment, as if you had run the evaluate function and received those outputs.\\n\\nCopy# Name of the dataset we want to create\\ndataset_name = f\\'{project_name}-backtesting {start_time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}-{end_time.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}\\'\\n# Name of the experiment we want to create from the historical runs\\nbaseline_experiment_name = f\"prod-baseline-gpt-3.5-turbo-{str(uuid4())[:4]}\"\\n\\n# This converts the runs to a dataset + experiment\\nconvert_runs_to_test(\\n    prod_runs,\\n    # Name of the resulting dataset\\n    dataset_name=dataset_name,\\n    # Whether to include the run outputs as reference/ground truth\\n    include_outputs=False,\\n    # Whether to include the full traces in the resulting experiment\\n    # (default is to just include the root run)\\n    load_child_runs=True,\\n    # Name of the experiment so we can apply evalautors to it after\\n    test_project_name=baseline_experiment_name\\n)\\n\\nOnce this step is complete, you should see a new dataset in your LangSmith project called “Tweet Writing Task-backtesting TODAYS DATE”, with a single experiment like so:\\n\\n\\u200bBenchmark against new system\\nNow we can start the process of benchmarking our production runs against a new system.\\n\\u200bDefine evaluators\\nFirst let’s define the evaluators we will use to compare the two systems. Note that we have no reference outputs, so we’ll need to come up with evaluation metrics that only require the actual outputs.\\nCopyimport emoji\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import convert_to_openai_messages\\n\\nclass Grade(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"Grade whether a response is supported by some context.\"\"\"\\n    grounded: bool = Field(..., description=\"Is the majority of the response supported by the retrieved context?\")\\n\\ngrounded_instructions = f\"\"\"You have given somebody some contextual information and asked them to write a statement grounded in that context.\\n\\nGrade whether their response is fully supported by the context you have provided. \\\\\\nIf any meaningful part of their statement is not backed up directly by the context you provided, then their response is not grounded. \\\\\\nOtherwise it is grounded.\"\"\"\\ngrounded_model = init_chat_model(model=\"gpt-4o\").with_structured_output(Grade)\\n\\ndef lt_280_chars(outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    messages = convert_to_openai_messages(outputs[\"messages\"])\\n    return len(messages[-1][\\'content\\']) <= 280\\n\\ndef gte_3_emojis(outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    messages = convert_to_openai_messages(outputs[\"messages\"])\\n    return len(emoji.emoji_list(messages[-1][\\'content\\'])) >= 3\\n\\nasync def is_grounded(outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    context = \"\"\\n    messages = convert_to_openai_messages(outputs[\"messages\"])\\n    for message in messages:\\n        if message[\"role\"] == \"tool\":\\n            # Tool message outputs are the results returned from the Tavily/DuckDuckGo tool\\n            context += \"\\\\n\\\\n\" + message[\"content\"]\\n    tweet = messages[-1][\"content\"]\\n    user = f\"\"\"CONTEXT PROVIDED:\\n    {context}\\n\\n    RESPONSE GIVEN:\\n    {tweet}\"\"\"\\n    grade = await grounded_model.ainvoke([\\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": grounded_instructions},\\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user}\\n    ])\\n    return grade.grounded\\n\\n\\u200bEvaluate baseline\\nNow, let’s run our evaluators against the baseline experiment.\\nCopybaseline_results = await client.aevaluate(\\n    baseline_experiment_name,\\n    evaluators=[lt_280_chars, gte_3_emojis, is_grounded],\\n)\\n# If you have pandas installed can easily explore results as df:\\n# baseline_results.to_pandas()\\n\\n\\u200bDefine and evaluate new system\\nNow, let’s define and evaluate our new system. In this example our new system will be the same as the old system, but will use GPT-4o instead of GPT-3.5. Since we’ve made our model configurable we can just update the default config passed to our agent:\\nCopycandidate_results = await client.aevaluate(\\n    agent.with_config(model=\"gpt-4o\"),\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[lt_280_chars, gte_3_emojis, is_grounded],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"candidate-gpt-4o\",\\n)\\n# If you have pandas installed can easily explore results as df:\\n# candidate_results.to_pandas()\\n\\n\\u200bComparing the results\\nAfter running both experiments, you can view them in your dataset:\\n\\nThe results reveal an interesting tradeoff between the two models:\\n\\nGPT-4o shows improved performance in following formatting rules, consistently including the requested number of emojis\\nHowever, GPT-4o is less reliable at staying grounded in the provided search results\\n\\nTo illustrate the grounding issue: in this example run, GPT-4o included facts about Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al-Rāzī’s medical contributions that weren’t present in the search results. This demonstrates how it’s pulling from its internal knowledge rather than strictly using the provided information.\\nThis backtesting exercise revealed that while GPT-4o is generally considered a more capable model, simply upgrading to it wouldn’t improve our tweet-writer. To effectively use GPT-4o, we would need to:\\n\\nRefine our prompts to more strongly emphasize using only provided information\\nOr modify our system architecture to better constrain the model’s outputs\\n\\nThis insight demonstrates the value of backtesting - it helped us identify potential issues before deployment.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsEvaluate a complex agentAnalyze an experiment⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

These allow you to measure how well your application is performing over a set of data. Being able to get this insight quickly and reliably will allow you to iterate with confidence.\\nAt a high level, in this tutorial we will:\\n\\nCreate an initial golden dataset to measure performance\\nDefine metrics to use to measure performance\\nRun evaluations on a few different prompts or models\\nCompare results manually\\nTrack results over time\\nSet up automated testing to run in CI/CD\\n\\nFor more information on the evaluation workflows LangSmith supports, check out the how-to guides, or see the reference docs for evaluate and its asynchronous aevaluate counterpart.\\nLots to cover, let’s dive in!\\n\\u200bSetup\\nFirst install the required dependencies for this tutorial. We happen to use OpenAI, but LangSmith can be used with any model:\\npipuvCopypip install -U langsmith openai\\n\\nAnd set environment variables to enable LangSmith tracing:\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"<Your LangSmith API key>\"\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<Your OpenAI API key>\"\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a dataset\\nThe first step when getting ready to test and evaluate your application is to define the datapoints you want to evaluate. There are a few aspects to consider here:\\n\\nWhat should the schema of each datapoint be?\\nHow many datapoints should I gather?\\nHow should I gather those datapoints?\\n\\nSchema: Each datapoint should consist of, at the very least, the inputs to the application. If you are able, it is also very helpful to define the expected outputs - these represent what you would expect a properly functioning application to output. Often times you cannot define the perfect output - that’s okay! Evaluation is an iterative process. Sometimes you may also want to define more information for each example - like the expected documents to fetch in RAG, or the expected steps to take as an agent. LangSmith datasets are very flexible and allow you to define arbitrary schemas.\\nHow many: There’s no hard and fast rule for how many you should gather. The main thing is to make sure you have proper coverage of edge cases you may want to guard against. Even 10-50 examples can provide a lot of value! Don’t worry about getting a large number to start - you can (and should) always add over time!\\nHow to get: This is maybe the trickiest part. Once you know you want to gather a dataset… how do you actually go about it? For most teams that are starting a new project, we generally see them start by collecting the first 10-20 datapoints by hand. After starting with these datapoints, these datasets are generally living constructs and grow over time. They generally grow after seeing how real users will use your application, seeing the pain points that exist, and then moving a few of those datapoints into this set. There are also methods like synthetically generating data that can be used to augment your dataset. To start, we recommend not worrying about those and just hand labeling ~10-20 examples.\\nOnce you’ve got your dataset, there are a few different ways to upload them to LangSmith. For this tutorial, we will use the client, but you can also upload via the UI (or even create them in the UI).\\nFor this tutorial, we will create 5 datapoints to evaluate on. We will be evaluating a question-answering application. The input will be a question, and the output will be an answer. Since this is a question-answering application, we can define the expected answer. Let’s show how to create and upload this dataset to LangSmith!\\nCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nclient = Client()\\n\\n# Define dataset: these are your test cases\\ndataset_name = \"QA Example Dataset\"\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name)\\n\\nclient.create_examples(\\n    dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n    examples=[\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is LangChain?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A framework for building LLM applications\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is LangSmith?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A platform for observing and evaluating LLM applications\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is OpenAI?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A company that creates Large Language Models\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is Google?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A technology company known for search\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is Mistral?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A company that creates Large Language Models\"},\\n        }\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\nNow, if we go the LangSmith UI and look for QA Example Dataset in the Datasets & Testing page, when we click into it we should see that we have five new examples.\\n\\n\\u200bDefine metrics\\nAfter creating our dataset, we can now define some metrics to evaluate our responses on. Since we have an expected answer, we can compare to that as part of our evaluation. However, we do not expect our application to output those exact answers, but rather something that is similar. This makes our evaluation a little trickier.\\nIn addition to evaluating correctness, let’s also make sure our answers are short and concise. This will be a little easier - we can define a simple Python function to measure the length of the response.\\nLet’s go ahead and define these two metrics.\\nFor the first, we will use an LLM to judge whether the output is correct (with respect to the expected output). This LLM-as-a-judge is relatively common for cases that are too complex to measure with a simple function. We can define our own prompt and LLM to use for evaluation here:\\nCopyimport openai\\nfrom langsmith import wrappers\\n\\nopenai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(openai.OpenAI())\\n\\neval_instructions = \"You are an expert professor specialized in grading students\\' answers to questions.\"\\n\\ndef correctness(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    user_content = f\"\"\"You are grading the following question:\\n{inputs[\\'question\\']}\\nHere is the real answer:\\n{reference_outputs[\\'answer\\']}\\nYou are grading the following predicted answer:\\n{outputs[\\'response\\']}\\nRespond with CORRECT or INCORRECT:\\nGrade:\"\"\"\\n    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": eval_instructions},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_content},\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n    return response == \"CORRECT\"\\n\\nFor evaluating the length of the response, this is a lot easier! We can just define a simple function that checks whether the actual output is less than 2x the length of the expected result.\\nCopydef concision(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    return int(len(outputs[\"response\"]) < 2 * len(reference_outputs[\"answer\"]))\\n\\n\\u200bRun Evaluations\\nGreat! So now how do we run evaluations? Now that we have a dataset and evaluators, all that we need is our application! We will build a simple application that just has a system message with instructions on how to respond and then passes it to the LLM. We will build this using the OpenAI SDK directly:\\nCopydefault_instructions = \"Respond to the users question in a short, concise manner (one short sentence).\"\\n\\ndef my_app(question: str, model: str = \"gpt-4o-mini\", instructions: str = default_instructions) -> str:\\n    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=model,\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question},\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n\\nBefore running this through LangSmith evaluations, we need to define a simple wrapper that maps the input keys from our dataset to the function we want to call, and then also maps the output of the function to the output key we expect.\\nCopydef ls_target(inputs: str) -> dict:\\n    return {\"response\": my_app(inputs[\"question\"])}\\n\\nGreat! Now we’re ready to run an evaluation. Let’s do it!\\nCopyexperiment_results = client.evaluate(\\n    ls_target, # Your AI system\\n    data=dataset_name, # The data to predict and grade over\\n    evaluators=[concision, correctness], # The evaluators to score the results\\n    experiment_prefix=\"openai-4o-mini\", # A prefix for your experiment names to easily identify them\\n)\\n\\nThis will output a URL. If we click on it, we should see results of our evaluation!\\n\\nIf we go back to the dataset page and select the Experiments tab, we can now see a summary of our one run!\\n\\nLet’s now try it out with a different model! Let’s try gpt-4-turbo\\nCopydef ls_target_v2(inputs: str) -> dict:\\n    return {\"response\": my_app(inputs[\"question\"], model=\"gpt-4-turbo\")}\\n\\nexperiment_results = client.evaluate(\\n    ls_target_v2,\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[concision, correctness],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"openai-4-turbo\",\\n)\\n\\nAnd now let’s use GPT-4 but also update the prompt to be a bit more strict in requiring the answer to be short.\\nCopyinstructions_v3 = \"Respond to the users question in a short, concise manner (one short sentence). Do NOT use more than ten words.\"\\n\\ndef ls_target_v3(inputs: str) -> dict:\\n    response = my_app(\\n        inputs[\"question\"],\\n        model=\"gpt-4-turbo\",\\n        instructions=instructions_v3\\n    )\\n    return {\"response\": response}\\n\\nexperiment_results = client.evaluate(\\n    ls_target_v3,\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[concision, correctness],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"strict-openai-4-turbo\",\\n)\\n\\nIf we go back to the Experiments tab on the datasets page, we should see that all three runs now show up!\\n\\n\\u200bComparing results\\nAwesome, we’ve evaluated three different runs. But how can we compare results? The first way we can do this is just by looking at the runs in the Experiments tab. If we do that, we can see a high level view of the metrics for each run:\\n\\nGreat! So we can tell that GPT-4 is better than GPT-3.5 at knowing who companies are, and we can see that the strict prompt helped a lot with the length. But what if we want to explore in more detail?\\nIn order to do that, we can select all the runs we want to compare (in this case all three) and open them up in a comparison view. We immediately see all three tests side by side. Some of the cells are color coded - this is showing a regression of a certain metric compared to a certain baseline. We automatically choose defaults for the baseline and metric, but you can change those yourself. You can also choose which columns and which metrics you see by using the Display control. You can also automatically filter to only see the runs that have improvements/regressions by clicking on the icons at the top.\\n\\nIf we want to see more information, we can also select the Expand button that appears when hovering over a row to open up a side panel with more detailed information:\\n\\n\\u200bSet up automated testing to run in CI/CD\\nNow that we’ve run this in a one-off manner, we can set it to run in an automated fashion. We can do this pretty easily by just including it as a pytest file that we run in CI/CD. As part of this, we can either just log the results OR set up some criteria to determine if it passes or not. For example, if I wanted to ensure that we always got at least 80% of generated responses passing the length check, we could set that up with a test like:\\nCopydef test_length_score() -> None:\\n    \"\"\"Test that the length score is at least 80%.\"\"\"\\n    experiment_results = evaluate(\\n        ls_target, # Your AI system\\n        data=dataset_name, # The data to predict and grade over\\n        evaluators=[concision, correctness], # The evaluators to score the results\\n    )\\n    # This will be cleaned up in the next release:\\n    feedback = client.list_feedback(\\n        run_ids=[r.id for r in client.list_runs(project_name=experiment_results.experiment_name)],\\n        feedback_key=\"concision\"\\n    )\\n    scores = [f.score for f in feedback]\\n    assert sum(scores) / len(scores) >= 0.8, \"Aggregate score should be at least .8\"\\n\\n\\u200bTrack results over time\\nNow that we’ve got these experiments running in an automated fashion, we want to track these results over time. We can do this from the overall Experiments tab in the datasets page. By default, we show evaluation metrics over time (highlighted in red). We also automatically track git metrics, to easily associate it with the branch of your code (highlighted in yellow).\\n\\n\\u200bConclusion\\nThat’s it for this tutorial!\\nWe’ve gone over how to create an initial test set, define some evaluation metrics, run experiments, compare them manually, set up CI/CD, and track results over time. Hopefully this can help you iterate with confidence.\\nThis is just the start. As mentioned earlier, evaluation is an ongoing process. For example - the datapoints you will want to evaluate on will likely continue to change over time. There are many types of evaluators you may wish to explore. For information on this, check out the how-to guides.\\nAdditionally, there are other ways to evaluate data besides in this “offline” manner (e.g. you can evaluate production data). For more information on online evaluation, check out this guide.\\n\\u200bReference code\\nClick to see a consolidated code snippetCopyimport openai\\nfrom langsmith import Client, wrappers\\n\\n# Application code\\nopenai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(openai.OpenAI())\\n\\ndefault_instructions = \"Respond to the users question in a short, concise manner (one short sentence).\"\\n\\ndef my_app(question: str, model: str = \"gpt-4o-mini\", instructions: str = default_instructions) -> str:\\n    return openai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=model,\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": instructions},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question},\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n\\nclient = Client()\\n\\n# Define dataset: these are your test cases\\ndataset_name = \"QA Example Dataset\"\\ndataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name)\\n\\nclient.create_examples(\\n    dataset_id=dataset.id,\\n    examples=[\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is LangChain?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A framework for building LLM applications\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is LangSmith?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A platform for observing and evaluating LLM applications\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is OpenAI?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A company that creates Large Language Models\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is Google?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A technology company known for search\"},\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"inputs\": {\"question\": \"What is Mistral?\"},\\n            \"outputs\": {\"answer\": \"A company that creates Large Language Models\"},\\n        }\\n    ]\\n)\\n\\n# Define evaluators\\neval_instructions = \"You are an expert professor specialized in grading students\\' answers to questions.\"\\n\\ndef correctness(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    user_content = f\"\"\"You are grading the following question:\\n{inputs[\\'question\\']}\\nHere is the real answer:\\n{reference_outputs[\\'answer\\']}\\nYou are grading the following predicted answer:\\n{outputs[\\'response\\']}\\nRespond with CORRECT or INCORRECT:\\nGrade:\"\"\"\\n    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": eval_instructions},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_content},\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n    return response == \"CORRECT\"\\n\\ndef concision(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:\\n    return int(len(outputs[\"response\"]) < 2 * len(reference_outputs[\"answer\"]))\\n\\n# Run evaluations\\ndef ls_target(inputs: str) -> dict:\\n    return {\"response\": my_app(inputs[\"question\"])}\\n\\nexperiment_results_v1 = client.evaluate(\\n    ls_target, # Your AI system\\n    data=dataset_name, # The data to predict and grade over\\n    evaluators=[concision, correctness], # The evaluators to score the results\\n    experiment_prefix=\"openai-4o-mini\", # A prefix for your experiment names to easily identify them\\n)\\n\\ndef ls_target_v2(inputs: str) -> dict:\\n    return {\"response\": my_app(inputs[\"question\"], model=\"gpt-4-turbo\")}\\n\\nexperiment_results_v2 = client.evaluate(\\n    ls_target_v2,\\n    data=dataset_name,\\n    evaluators=[concision, correctness],\\n    experiment_prefix=\"openai-4-turbo\",\\n)\\n\\ninstructions_v3 = \"Respond to the users question in a short, concise manner (one short sentence).

In this walkthrough we will show you how to load the SWE-bench dataset into LangSmith and easily run evals on it, allowing you to have much better visibility into your agents behaviour then using the off-the-shelf SWE-bench eval suite. This allows you to pin specific problems quicker and iterate on your agent rapidly to improve performance!\\n\\u200bLoading the data\\nTo load the data, we will pull the dev split from Hugging Face, but for your use case you may wish to pull one of the test, or train splits, and if you want to combine multiple splits you can use pd.concat.\\nCopyimport pandas as pd\\n\\nsplits = {\\n    \\'dev\\': \\'data/dev-00000-of-00001.parquet\\',\\n    \\'test\\': \\'data/test-00000-of-00001.parquet\\',\\n    \\'train\\': \\'data/train-00000-of-00001.parquet\\'\\n}\\n\\ndf = pd.read_parquet(\"hf://datasets/princeton-nlp/SWE-bench/\" + splits[\"dev\"])\\n\\n\\u200bEditing the ‘version’ column\\nThis is a very important step! If you skip, the rest of the code WILL NOT WORK!\\nThe version column contains all string values but all are in float format so they get converted to floats when you upload the CSV to create a LangSmith dataset. Although you can convert the values to strings during your experiments, the issue arises with values like \"0.10\". When getting converted to a float, you get the value 0.1, which would become \"0.1\" if you converted it to a string - causing a key error during execution of your proposed patch.\\nIn order to fix this, we need LangSmith to stop trying to convert the version column to floats. In order to do this, we can just append a string prefix to each of them that is not float compatible. We then need to split on this prefix when doing evaluation to get the actual version value. The prefix we choose here is the string \"version:\".\\nThe ability to select column types when uploading a CSV to LangSmith will be added in the future to avoid having to use this workaround.\\nCopydf[\\'version\\'] = df[\\'version\\'].apply(lambda x: f\"version:{x}\")\\n\\n\\u200bUpload the data to LangSmith\\n\\u200bSave to CSV\\nTo upload the data to LangSmith, we first need to save it to a CSV, which we can do using the to_csv function provided by pandas. Make sure to save this file somewhere that is easily accessible to you.\\nCopydf.to_csv(\"./../SWE-bench.csv\",index=False)\\n\\n\\u200bUpload CSV to LangSmith Manually\\nWe are now ready to upload the CSV to LangSmith. Once you are on the LangSmith website , go to the Datasets & Testing tab on the left side navigation bar, and then click the + New Dataset button in the top right corner.\\nThen click the Upload CSV button on the top, and select the CSV file you saved in the previous step. You can then give your dataset a name and description.\\nNext, select Key-Value as the dataset type. Lastly head to the Create Schema section and add ALL OF THE KEYS as Input fields. There are no Output fields in this example because our evaluator is not comparing against a reference, but instead will run the output of our experiments in docker containers to ensure that the code actually solves the PR issue.\\nOnce you have populated the Input fields (and left the Output fields empty!) you can click the blue Create button in the top right corner, and your dataset will be created!\\n\\u200bUpload CSV to LangSmith Programmatically\\nAlternatively you can upload your csv to LangSmith using the sdk as shown in the code block below:\\nCopydataset = client.upload_csv(\\n    csv_file=\"./../SWE-bench-dev.csv\",\\n    input_keys=list(df.columns),\\n    output_keys=[],\\n    name=\"swe-bench-programatic-upload\",\\n    description=\"SWE-bench dataset\",\\n    data_type=\"kv\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCreate dataset split for quicker testing\\nSince running the SWE-bench evaluator takes a long time when run on all examples, you can create a “test” split for quickly testing the evaluator and your code. Read this guide to learn more about managing dataset splits.\\n\\u200bRunning our prediction function\\nRunning evaluation over SWE-bench works a little differently than most evals you will typically run on LangSmith since we don’t have a reference output. Because of this, we first generate all of our outputs without running an evaluator (note how the evaluate call doesn’t have the evaluators parameter set). In this case we returned a dummy predict function, but you can insert your agent logic inside the predict function to make it work as intended.\\nCopyfrom langsmith import evaluate\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nclient = Client()\\n\\ndef predict(inputs: dict):\\n    return {\\n        \"instance_id\": inputs[\\'instance_id\\'],\\n        \"model_patch\": \"None\",\\n        \"model_name_or_path\": \"test-model\"\\n    }\\n\\nresult = evaluate(\\n    predict,\\n    data=client.list_examples(\\n        dataset_id=\"a9bffcdf-1dfe-4aef-8805-8806f0110067\",\\n        splits=[\"test\"]\\n    ),\\n)\\n\\nView the evaluation results for experiment: ‘perfect-lip-22’\\n\\u200bEvaluating our predictions using SWE-bench\\nNow we can run the following code to run the predicted patches we generated above in Docker. This code is edited slightly from the SWE-bench run_evaluation.py file.\\nBasically, the code sets up docker images to run the predictions in parallel, which greatly reduces the time needed for evaluation. This screenshot explains the basics of how SWE-bench does evaluation under the hood. To understand it in full, make sure to read through the code in the GitHub repository.\\n\\nThe function convert_runs_to_langsmith_feedback converts the logs generated by the docker file into a nice .json file that contains feedback in the typical key/score method of LangSmith.\\nCopyfrom swebench.harness.run_evaluation import run_instances\\nimport resource\\nimport docker\\nfrom swebench.harness.docker_utils import list_images, clean_images\\nfrom swebench.harness.docker_build import build_env_images\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport json\\nimport os\\n\\nRUN_EVALUATION_LOG_DIR = Path(\"logs/run_evaluation\")\\nLANGSMITH_EVALUATION_DIR = \\'./langsmith_feedback/feedback.json\\'\\n\\ndef convert_runs_to_langsmith_feedback(\\n    predictions: dict,\\n    full_dataset: list,\\n    run_id: str\\n) -> float:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Convert logs from docker containers into LangSmith feedback.\\n    Args:\\n        predictions (dict): Predictions dict generated by the model\\n        full_dataset (list): List of all instances\\n        run_id (str): Run ID\\n    \"\"\"\\n    feedback_for_all_instances = {}\\n    for instance in full_dataset:\\n        feedback_for_instance = []\\n        instance_id = instance[\\'instance_id\\']\\n        prediction = predictions[instance_id]\\n\\n        if prediction.get(\"model_patch\", None) in [\"\", None]:\\n            #

Each step within a trace is represented by a run. Multiple traces are grouped together within a project.\\nThe following diagram displays these concepts in the context of a simple RAG app, which retrieves documents from an index and generates an answer.\\n\\n\\u200bRuns\\nA run is a span representing a single unit of work or operation within your LLM application. This could be anything from a single call to an LLM or chain, to a prompt formatting call, to a runnable lambda invocation. If you are familiar with OpenTelemetry, you can think of a run as a span.\\n\\n\\u200bTraces\\nA trace is a collection of runs for a single operation. For example, if you have a user request that triggers a chain, and that chain makes a call to an LLM, then to an output parser, and so on, all of these runs would be part of the same trace. If you are familiar with OpenTelemetry, you can think of a LangSmith trace as a collection of spans. Runs are bound to a trace by a unique trace ID.\\n\\n\\u200bProjects\\nA project is a collection of traces. You can think of a project as a container for all the traces that are related to a single application or service. You can have multiple projects, and each project can have multiple traces.\\n\\n\\u200bFeedback\\nFeedback allows you to score an individual run based on certain criteria. Each feedback entry consists of a feedback tag and feedback score, and is bound to a run by a unique run ID. Feedback can be continuous or discrete (categorical), and you can reuse feedback tags across different runs within an organization.\\nYou can collect feedback on runs in a number of ways:\\n\\nSent up along with a trace from the LLM application.\\nGenerated by a user in the app inline or in an annotation queue.\\nGenerated by an automatic evaluator during offline evaluation.\\nGenerated by an online evaluator.\\n\\nTo learn more about how feedback is stored in the application, refer to the Feedback data format guide.\\n\\n\\u200bTags\\nTags are collections of strings that can be attached to runs. You can use tags to do the following in the LangSmith UI:\\n\\nCategorize runs for easier search.\\nFilter runs.\\nGroup runs together for analysis.\\n\\nLearn how to attach tags to your traces.\\n\\n\\u200bMetadata\\nMetadata is a collection of key-value pairs that you can attach to runs. You can use metadata to store additional information about a run, such as the version of the application that generated the run, the environment in which the run was generated, or any other information that you want to associate with a run. Similarly to tags, you can use metadata to filter runs in the LangSmith UI or group runs together for analysis.\\nLearn how to add metadata to your traces.\\n\\n\\u200bData storage and retention\\nFor traces ingested on or after Wednesday, May 22, 2024, LangSmith (SaaS) retains trace data for a maximum of 400 days past the date and time the trace was inserted into the LangSmith trace database.\\nAfter 400 days, the traces are permanently deleted from LangSmith, with a limited amount of metadata retained for the purpose of showing accurate statistics, such as historic usage and cost.\\nIf you wish to keep tracing data longer than the data retention period, you can add it to a dataset. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\\n\\u200bDeleting traces from LangSmith\\nIf you need to remove a trace from LangSmith before its expiration date, you can do so by deleting the project that contains it.\\nYou can delete a project with one of the following ways:\\n\\nIn the LangSmith UI, select the Delete option on the project’s overflow menu.\\nWith the delete_tracer_sessions API endpoint\\nWith the delete_project() (Python) or deleteProject() (JS/TS) in the LangSmith SDK.\\n\\nLangSmith does not support self-service deletion of individual traces.\\nIf you have a need to delete a single trace (or set of traces) from LangSmith project before its expiration date, the account owner should reach out to LangSmith Support with the organization ID and trace IDs.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewTutorial - Trace a RAG application⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

View your trace\\nBy default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name default. An example of a trace logged using the above code is made public and can be viewed here.\\n\\n\\u200bTrace selectively\\nThe previous section showed how to trace all invocations of a LangChain runnables within your applications by setting a single environment variable. While this is a convenient way to get started, you may want to trace only specific invocations or parts of your application.\\nThere are two ways to do this in Python: by manually passing in a LangChainTracer (reference docs) instance as a callback, or by using the tracing_context context manager (reference docs).\\nIn JS/TS, you can pass a LangChainTracer (reference docs) instance as a callback.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# You can opt-in to specific invocations..\\nimport langsmith as ls\\n\\nwith ls.tracing_context(enabled=True):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I using a callback?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m using a callback\"})\\n\\n# This will NOT be traced (assuming LANGSMITH_TRACING is not set)\\nchain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I being traced?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m not being traced\"})\\n\\n# This would not be traced, even if LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\\nwith ls.tracing_context(enabled=False):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I being traced?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m not being traced\"})\\n\\n\\u200bLog to a specific project\\n\\u200bStatically\\nAs mentioned in the tracing conceptual guide LangSmith uses the concept of a Project to group traces. If left unspecified, the tracer project is set to default. You can set the LANGSMITH_PROJECT environment variable to configure a custom project name for an entire application run. This should be done before executing your application.\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_PROJECT=my-project\\n\\nThe LANGSMITH_PROJECT flag is only supported in JS SDK versions >= 0.2.16, use LANGCHAIN_PROJECT instead if you are using an older version.\\n\\u200bDynamically\\nThis largely builds off of the previous section and allows you to set the project name for a specific LangChainTracer instance or as parameters to the tracing_context context manager in Python.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# You can set the project name using the project_name parameter.\\nimport langsmith as ls\\n\\nwith ls.tracing_context(project_name=\"My Project\", enabled=True):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I using a context manager?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m using a context manager\"})\\n\\n\\u200bAdd metadata and tags to traces\\nYou can annotate your traces with arbitrary metadata and tags by providing them in the RunnableConfig. This is useful for associating additional information with a trace, such as the environment in which it was executed, or the user who initiated it. For information on how to query traces and runs by metadata and tags, see this guide\\nWhen you attach metadata or tags to a runnable (either through the RunnableConfig or at runtime with invocation params), they are inherited by all child runnables of that runnable.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful AI.\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\")\\n])\\n\\n# The tag \"model-tag\" and metadata {\"model-key\": \"model-value\"} will be attached to the ChatOpenAI run only\\nchat_model = ChatOpenAI().with_config({\"tags\": [\"model-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"model-key\": \"model-value\"}})\\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\\n\\n# Tags and metadata can be configured with RunnableConfig\\nchain = (prompt | chat_model | output_parser).with_config({\"tags\": [\"config-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"config-key\": \"config-value\"}})\\n\\n# Tags and metadata can also be passed at runtime\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"tags\": [\"invoke-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"invoke-key\": \"invoke-value\"}})\\n\\n\\u200bCustomize run name\\nYou can customize the name of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the Config. This name is used to identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to filter and group runs. The name is also used as the title of the run in the LangSmith UI. This can be done by setting a run_name in the RunnableConfig object at construction or by passing a run_name in the invocation parameters in JS/TS.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# When tracing within LangChain, run names default to the class name of the traced object (e.g., \\'ChatOpenAI\\').\\nconfigured_chain = chain.with_config({\"run_name\": \"MyCustomChain\"})\\nconfigured_chain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"})\\n\\n# You can also configure the run name at invocation time, like below\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"run_name\": \"MyCustomChain\"})\\n\\nThe run_name parameter only changes the name of the runnable you invoke (e.g., a chain, function). It does not rename the nested run automatically created when you invoke an LLM object like ChatOpenAI (gpt-4o-mini). In the example, the enclosing run will appear in LangSmith as MyCustomChain, while the nested LLM run still shows the model’s default name.To give the LLM run a more meaningful name, you can either:\\nWrap the model in another runnable and assign a run_name to that step.\\nUse a tracing decorator or helper (e.g., @traceable in Python, or traceable from langsmith in JS/TS) to create a custom run around the model call.\\n\\n\\u200bCustomize run ID\\nYou can customize the ID of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the Config. This ID is used to uniquely identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to query specific runs. The ID can be useful for linking runs across different systems or for implementing custom tracking logic. This can be done by setting a run_id in the RunnableConfig object at construction or by passing a run_id in the invocation parameters.\\nThis feature is not currently supported directly for LLM objects.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport uuid\\n\\nmy_uuid = uuid.uuid4()\\n\\n# You can configure the run ID at invocation time:\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"run_id\": my_uuid})\\n\\nNote that if you do this at the root of a trace (i.e., the top-level run, that run ID will be used as the trace_id).\\n\\u200bAccess run (span) ID for LangChain invocations\\nWhen you invoke a LangChain object, you can manually specify the run ID of the invocation. This run ID can be used to query the run in LangSmith.\\nIn JS/TS, you can use a RunCollectorCallbackHandler instance to access the run ID.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport uuid\\n\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user\\'s request only based on the given context.\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"Question: {question}\\\\n\\\\nContext: {context}\")\\n])\\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\\n\\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\\n\\nquestion = \"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\"\\ncontext = \"During this morning\\'s meeting, we solved all world conflict.\"\\nmy_uuid = uuid.uuid4()\\nresult = chain.invoke({\"question\": question, \"context\": context}, {\"run_id\": my_uuid})\\nprint(my_uuid)\\n\\n\\u200bEnsure all traces are submitted before exiting\\nIn LangChain Python, LangSmith’s tracing is done in a background thread to avoid obstructing your production application. This means that your process may end before all traces are successfully posted to LangSmith. This is especially prevalent in a serverless environment, where your VM may be terminated immediately once your chain or agent completes.\\nYou can make callbacks synchronous by setting the LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND environment variable to \"false\".\\nFor both languages, LangChain exposes methods to wait for traces to be submitted before exiting your application. Below is an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.tracers.langchain import wait_for_all_tracers\\n\\nllm = ChatOpenAI()\\n\\ntry:\\n  llm.invoke(\"Hello, World!\")\\nfinally:\\n  wait_for_all_tracers()\\n\\n\\u200bTrace without setting environment variables\\nAs mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:\\n\\nLANGSMITH_TRACING\\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY\\nLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT\\nLANGSMITH_PROJECT\\n\\nHowever, in some environments, it is not possible to set environment variables. In these cases, you can set the tracing configuration programmatically.\\nThis largely builds off of the previous section.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport langsmith as ls\\n\\n# You can create a client instance with an api key and api url\\nclient = ls.Client(\\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",  # This can be retrieved from a secrets manager\\n    api_url=\"https://api.smith.langchain.com\",  # Update appropriately for self-hosted installations or the EU region\\n)\\n\\n# You can pass the client and project_name to the tracing_context\\nwith ls.tracing_context(client=client, project_name=\"test-no-env\", enabled=True):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I using a callback?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m using a callback\"})\\n\\n\\u200bDistributed tracing with LangChain (Python)\\nLangSmith supports distributed tracing with LangChain Python. This allows you to link runs (spans) across different services and applications. The principles are similar to the distributed tracing guide for the LangSmith SDK.\\nCopyimport langsmith\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import chain\\nfrom langsmith.run_helpers import get_current_run_tree\\n\\n# -- This code should be in a separate file or service --\\n@chain\\ndef child_chain(inputs):\\n    return inputs[\"test\"] + 1\\n\\ndef child_wrapper(x, headers):\\n    with langsmith.tracing_context(parent=headers):\\n        child_chain.invoke({\"test\": x})\\n\\n# -- This code should be in a separate file or service --\\n@chain\\ndef parent_chain(inputs):\\n    rt = get_current_run_tree()\\n    headers = rt.to_headers()\\n    # ... make a request to another service with the headers\\n    # The headers should be passed to the other service, eventually to the child_wrapper function\\n\\nparent_chain.invoke({\"test\": 1})\\n\\n\\u200bInteroperability between LangChain (Python) and LangSmith SDK\\nIf you are using LangChain for part of your application and the LangSmith SDK (see this guide) for other parts, you can still trace the entire application seamlessly.\\nLangChain objects will be traced when invoked within a traceable function and be bound as a child run of the traceable function.\\nCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\nfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant.

The following limitations are present when using combining LangChain with traceable:\\nMutating RunTree obtained from getCurrentRunTree() of the RunnableLambda context will result in a no-op.\\nIt’s discouraged to traverse the RunTree obtained from RunnableLambda via getCurrentRunTree() as it may not contain all the RunTree nodes.\\nDifferent child runs may have the same execution_order and child_execution_order value. Thus in extreme circumstances, some runs may end up in a different order, depending on the start_time.\\n\\nIn some uses cases, you might want to run traceable functions as part of the RunnableSequence or trace child runs of LangChain run imperatively via the RunTree API. Starting with LangSmith 0.1.39 and @langchain/core 0.2.18, you can directly invoke traceable-wrapped functions within RunnableLambda.\\nCopyimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { RunnableLambda } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\nimport { RunnableConfig } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\n\\nconst tracedChild = traceable((input: string) => `Child Run: ${input}`, {\\n  name: \"Child Run\",\\n});\\n\\nconst parrot = new RunnableLambda({\\n  func: async (input: { text: string }, config?: RunnableConfig) => {\\n    return await tracedChild(input.text);\\n  },\\n});\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, you can convert LangChain’s RunnableConfig to a equivalent RunTree object by using RunTree.fromRunnableConfig or pass the RunnableConfig as the first argument of traceable-wrapped function.\\nTraceableRun TreeCopyimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { RunnableLambda } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\nimport { RunnableConfig } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\n\\nconst tracedChild = traceable((input: string) => `Child Run: ${input}`, {\\n  name: \"Child Run\",\\n});\\n\\nconst parrot = new RunnableLambda({\\n  func: async (input: { text: string }, config?: RunnableConfig) => {\\n    // Pass the config to existing traceable function\\n    await tracedChild(config, input.text);\\n    return input.text;\\n  },\\n});\\n\\nIf you prefer a video tutorial, check out the Alternative Ways to Trace video from the Introduction to LangSmith Course.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewLangGraph⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Note that this does not affect the RunTree objects or API users, as these are meant to be low-level and not affected by the tracing toggle.\\nThere are several ways to log traces to LangSmith.\\nIf you are using LangChain (either Python or JS/TS), you can skip this section and go directly to the LangChain-specific instructions.\\n\\u200bUse @traceable / traceable\\nLangSmith makes it easy to log traces with minimal changes to your existing code with the @traceable decorator in Python and traceable function in TypeScript.\\nThe LANGSMITH_TRACING environment variable must be set to \\'true\\' in order for traces to be logged to LangSmith, even when using @traceable or traceable. This allows you to toggle tracing on and off without changing your code.Additionally, you will need to set the LANGSMITH_API_KEY environment variable to your API key (see Setup for more information).By default, the traces will be logged to a project named default. To log traces to a different project, see this section.\\nThe @traceable decorator is a simple way to log traces from the LangSmith Python SDK. Simply decorate any function with @traceable.\\nNote that when wrapping a sync function with traceable, (e.g. formatPrompt in the example below), you should use the await keyword when calling it to\\nensure the trace is logged correctly.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\nfrom openai import Client\\n\\nopenai = Client()\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef format_prompt(subject):\\n  return [\\n      {\\n          \"role\": \"system\",\\n          \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\\n      },\\n      {\\n          \"role\": \"user\",\\n          \"content\": f\"What\\'s a good name for a store that sells {subject}?\"\\n      }\\n  ]\\n\\n@traceable(run_type=\"llm\")\\ndef invoke_llm(messages):\\n  return openai.chat.completions.create(\\n      messages=messages, model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0\\n  )\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef parse_output(response):\\n  return response.choices[0].message.content\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef run_pipeline():\\n  messages = format_prompt(\"colorful socks\")\\n  response = invoke_llm(messages)\\n  return parse_output(response)\\n\\nrun_pipeline()\\n\\n\\n\\u200bUse the trace context manager (Python only)\\nIn Python, you can use the trace context manager to log traces to LangSmith. This is useful in situations where:\\n\\nYou want to log traces for a specific block of code.\\nYou want control over the inputs, outputs, and other attributes of the trace.\\nIt is not feasible to use a decorator or wrapper.\\nAny or all of the above.\\n\\nThe context manager integrates seamlessly with the traceable decorator and wrap_openai wrapper, so you can use them together in the same application.\\nCopyimport openai\\nimport langsmith as ls\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\n\\nclient = wrap_openai(openai.Client())\\n\\n@ls.traceable(run_type=\"tool\", name=\"Retrieve Context\")\\ndef my_tool(question: str) -> str:\\n    return \"During this morning\\'s meeting, we solved all world conflict.\"\\n\\ndef chat_pipeline(question: str):\\n    context = my_tool(question)\\n    messages = [\\n        { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user\\'s request only based on the given context.\" },\\n        { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Question: {question}\\\\nContext: {context}\"}\\n    ]\\n    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", messages=messages\\n    )\\n    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content\\n\\napp_inputs = {\"input\": \"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\"}\\n\\nwith ls.trace(\"Chat Pipeline\", \"chain\", project_name=\"my_test\", inputs=app_inputs) as rt:\\n    output = chat_pipeline(\"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\")\\n    rt.end(outputs={\"output\": output})\\n\\n\\u200bUse the RunTree API\\nAnother, more explicit way to log traces to LangSmith is via the RunTree API. This API allows you more control over your tracing - you can manually create runs and children runs to assemble your trace. You still need to set your LANGSMITH_API_KEY, but LANGSMITH_TRACING is not necessary for this method.\\nThis method is not recommended, as it’s easier to make mistakes in propagating trace context.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport openai\\nfrom langsmith.run_trees import RunTree\\n\\n# This can be a user input to your app\\nquestion = \"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\"\\n\\n# Create a top-level run\\npipeline = RunTree(\\n  name=\"Chat Pipeline\",\\n  run_type=\"chain\",\\n  inputs={\"question\": question}\\n)\\npipeline.post()\\n\\n# This can be retrieved in a retrieval step\\ncontext = \"During this morning\\'s meeting, we solved all world conflict.\"\\nmessages = [\\n  { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user\\'s request only based on the given context.\" },\\n  { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": f\"Question: {question}\\\\nContext: {context}\"}\\n]\\n\\n# Create a child run\\nchild_llm_run = pipeline.create_child(\\n  name=\"OpenAI Call\",\\n  run_type=\"llm\",\\n  inputs={\"messages\": messages},\\n)\\nchild_llm_run.post()\\n\\n# Generate a completion\\nclient = openai.Client()\\nchat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", messages=messages\\n)\\n\\n# End the runs and log them\\nchild_llm_run.end(outputs=chat_completion)\\nchild_llm_run.patch()\\npipeline.end(outputs={\"answer\": chat_completion.choices[0].message.content})\\npipeline.patch()\\n\\n\\u200bExample usage\\nYou can extend the utilities above to conveniently trace any code. Below are some example extensions:\\nTrace any public method in a class:\\nCopyfrom typing import Any, Callable, Type, TypeVar\\n\\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\\n\\ndef traceable_cls(cls: Type[T]) -> Type[T]:\\n    \"\"\"Instrument all public methods in a class.\"\"\"\\n    def wrap_method(name: str, method: Any) -> Any:\\n        if callable(method) and not name.startswith(\"__\"):\\n            return traceable(name=f\"{cls.__name__}.{name}\")(method)\\n        return method\\n\\n    # Handle __dict__ case\\n    for name in dir(cls):\\n        if not name.startswith(\"_\"):\\n            try:\\n                method = getattr(cls, name)\\n                setattr(cls, name, wrap_method(name, method))\\n            except AttributeError:\\n                # Skip attributes that can\\'t be set (e.g., some descriptors)\\n                pass\\n\\n    # Handle __slots__ case\\n    if hasattr(cls, \"__slots__\"):\\n        for slot in cls.__slots__:  # type: ignore[attr-defined]\\n            if not slot.startswith(\"__\"):\\n                try:\\n                    method = getattr(cls, slot)\\n                    setattr(cls, slot, wrap_method(slot, method))\\n                except AttributeError:\\n                    # Skip slots that don\\'t have a value yet\\n                    pass\\n\\n    return cls\\n\\n@traceable_cls\\nclass MyClass:\\n    def __init__(self, some_val: int):\\n        self.some_val = some_val\\n\\n    def combine(self, other_val: int):\\n        return self.some_val + other_val\\n\\n# See trace: https://smith.langchain.com/public/882f9ecf-5057-426a-ae98-0edf84fdcaf9/r\\nMyClass(13).combine(29)\\n\\n\\u200bEnsure all traces are submitted before exiting\\nLangSmith’s tracing is done in a background thread to avoid obstructing your production application.

The costs are rolled up to the trace and project level.\\nThere are two ways costs can be tracked:\\n\\nDerived from token counts and model prices\\nDirectly specified as part of the run data\\n\\nIn most cases it is easier to include token counts in the run data and specify model pricing in LangSmith. LangSmith assumes that costs are linear in token counts, broken down by token type. For the few models with non-linear pricing (e.g., above X input tokens the per-token price changes), we recommend computing costs client-side and sending them as part of the run data.\\n\\u200bSend token counts\\nFor LangSmith to accurately derive costs for an LLM run, you need to provide token counts:\\n\\nIf you are using the LangSmith Python or TS/JS SDK with OpenAI or Anthropic models, the built-in wrappers will automatically send up token counts, model provider and model name data to LangSmith.\\nIf you are using the LangSmith SDK’s with other model providers, you should carefully read through this guide.\\nIf you are using LangChain Python or TS/JS, token counts, model provider, and model name are automatically sent up to LangSmith for most chat model integrations. If there is a chat model integration that is missing token counts and for which the underlying API includes token counts in the model response, please open a GitHub issue in the LangChain repo.\\n\\nIf token counts are not explicitly specified, LangSmith will approximate the token counts of the LLM messages using tiktoken.\\n\\u200bSpecify model name\\nLangSmith reads the LLM model name from the ls_model_name field in run metadata. The SDK built-in wrappers and any LangChain integrations will automatically handle specifying this metadata for you.\\n\\u200bSet model prices\\nTo compute costs from token counts and model names, we need to know the per-token prices for the model you’re using. LangSmith has a model pricing table for this. The table comes with pricing information for most OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models. You can add prices for other models, or overwrite pricing for default models.\\nYou can specify prices for prompt (input) and completion (output) tokens. If needed you can provide a more detailed breakdown of prices. For example, some model providers have different pricing for multimodal or cached tokens.\\n\\nHovering over the ... next to the prompt/completion prices shows you the price breakdown by token type. You can see, for example, if audio and image prompt tokens have different prices versus default text prompt tokens.\\nTo create a new entry in the model pricing map, click on the Add new model button in the top right corner.\\n\\nHere, you can specify the following fields:\\n\\nModel Name: The human-readable name of the model.\\nMatch Pattern: A regex pattern to match the model name. This is used to match the value for ls_model_name in the run metadata.\\nPrompt (Input) Price: The cost per 1M input tokens for the model. This number is multiplied by the number of tokens in the prompt to calculate the prompt cost.\\nCompletion (Output) Price: The cost per 1M output tokens for the model. This number is multiplied by the number of tokens in the completion to calculate the completion cost.\\nPrompt (Input) Price Breakdown (Optional): The breakdown of price for each different type of prompt token, e.g. cache_read, video, audio, etc.\\nCompletion (Output) Price Breakdown (Optional): The breakdown of price for each different type of completion token, e.g. reasoning, image, etc.\\nModel Activation Date (Optional): The date from which the pricing is applicable. Only runs after this date will apply this model price.\\nProvider (Optional): The provider of the model. If specified, this is matched against ls_provider in the run metadata.\\n\\nOnce you have set up the model pricing map, LangSmith will automatically calculate and aggregate the token-based costs for traces based on the token counts provided in the LLM invocations.\\nPlease note that updates to the model pricing map are will not be reflected in the costs for traces already logged. We do not currently support backfilling model pricing changes.\\nFor specifying pricing breakdowns, here are the detailed token count types used by LangChain chat model integrations and LangSmith SDK wrappers:\\nCopy# Standardized\\ncache_read\\ncache_creation\\nreasoning\\naudio\\nimage\\nvideo\\n# Anthropic-only\\nephemeral_1h_input_tokens\\nephemeral_5m_input_tokens\\n\\n\\u200bCost formula\\nThe cost for a run is computed greedily from most-to-lease specific token type. Suppose we set a price of 2per1Mprompttokenswithadetailedpriceof2 per 1M prompt tokens with a detailed price of 2per1Mprompttokenswithadetailedpriceof1 per 1M cache_read prompt tokens, and $3 per 1M completion tokens.

The API may change in future releases.\\nThe LangSmith Collector-Proxy is a lightweight, high-performance proxy server that sits between your application and the LangSmith backend. It batches and compresses trace data before sending it to LangSmith, reducing network overhead and improving performance.\\n\\u200bWhen to Use the Collector-Proxy\\nThe Collector-Proxy is particularly valuable when:\\n\\nYou’re running multiple instances of your application in parallel and need to efficiently aggregate traces\\nYou want more efficient tracing than direct OTEL API calls to LangSmith (the collector optimizes batching and compression)\\nYou’re using a language that doesn’t have a native LangSmith SDK\\n\\n\\u200bKey Features\\n\\nEfficient Data Transfer Batches multiple spans into

Dashboards are available in the Monitoring tab in the left sidebar.\\nLangSmith offers two dashboard types:\\n\\nPrebuilt dashboards: Automatically generated for every tracing project.\\nCustom dashboards: Fully configurable collections of charts tailored to your needs.\\n\\n\\u200bPrebuilt dashboards\\nPrebuilt dashboards are created automatically for each project and cover essential metrics, such as trace count, error rates, token usage, and more. By default, the prebuilt dashboard for your tracing project can be accessed using the Dashboard button on the top right of the tracing project page.\\n\\nYou cannot modify a prebuilt dashboard. In the future, we plan to allow you to clone a default dashboard in order to have a starting point to customize it.\\n\\u200bDashboard sections\\nPrebuilt dashboards are broken down into the following sections:\\nSectionWhat it showsTracesTrace count, latency and error rates. A trace is a collection of runs related to a single operation. For example, if a user request triggers an agent, all runs for that agent invocation would be part of the same trace.LLM CallsLLM call count and latency. Includes all runs where run type is “llm”.Cost & TokensTotal and per-trace token counts and costs, broken down by token type. Costs are measured using LangSmith’s cost tracking.ToolsRun counts, error rates, and latency stats for tool runs broken down by tool name. Includes runs where run type is “tool”. Limits to top 5 most frequently occurring tools.Run TypesRun counts, error rates, and latency stats for runs that are immediate children of the root run. This helps in understanding the high-level execution path of agents. Limits to top 5 most frequently occurring run names. Refer to the image following this table.Feedback ScoresAggregate stats for the top 5 most frequently occurring types of feedback. Charts show average score for numerical feedback and category counts for categorical feedback.\\nFor example, for the following trace, the following runs have a depth of 1:\\n\\n\\u200bGroup by\\nGroup by run tag or metadata can be used to split data over attributes that are important to your application. The global group by setting appears on the top right hand side of the dashboard. Note that the Tool and Run Type charts already have a group by applied, so the global group by won’t take effect; the global group by will apply to all other charts.\\nWhen adding metadata to runs, we recommend having the same metadata on the trace, as well as the specific run (e.g. LLM call). Metadata and tags are not propagated from parent to child runs, or vice versa. So, if you want to see e.g. both your trace charts and your LLM call charts grouped on some metadata key then both your traces (root runs) and your LLM runs need to have that metadata attached.\\n\\u200bCustom Dashboards\\nCreate tailored collections of charts for tracking metrics that matter most for your application.\\n\\u200bCreating a new dashboard\\n\\nNavigate to the Monitor tab in the left sidebar.\\nClick on the + New Dashboard button.\\nGive your dashboard a name and a description.\\nClick on Create.\\n\\n\\u200bAdding charts to your dashboard\\n\\nWithin a dashboard, click on the + New Chart button to open up the chart creation pane.\\nGive your chart a name and a description.\\nConfigure the chart.\\n\\n\\u200bChart configuration\\n\\u200bSelect tracing projects and filter runs\\n\\nSelect one or more tracing projects to track metrics for.\\nUse the Chart filters section to refine the matching runs. This filter applies to all data series in the chart. For more information on filtering traces, view our guide on filtering traces in application.\\n\\n\\u200bPick a metric\\n\\nChoose a metric from the dropdown menu to set the y-axis of your chart. With a project and a metric selected, you’ll see a preview of your chart and the matching runs.\\nFor certain metrics (such as latency, token usage, cost), we support comparing multiple metrics with the same unit. For example, you may want one chart where you can see prompt tokens and completion tokens. Each metric appears as a separate line.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bSplit the data\\nThere are two ways to create multiple series in a chart (i.e. create multiple lines in a chart):\\n\\n\\nGroup by: Group runs by run tag or metadata, run name, or run type. Group by automatically splits the data into multiple series based on the field selected. Note that group by is limited to the top 5 elements by frequency.\\n\\n\\nData series: Manually define multiple series with individual filters. This is useful for comparing granular data within a single metric.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bPick a chart type\\n\\nChoose between a line chart and a bar chart for visualizing\\n\\n\\u200bSave and manage charts\\n\\nClick Save to save your chart to the dashboard.\\nEdit or delete a chart by clicking the triple dot button in the top right of the chart.\\nClone a chart by clicking the triple line button in the top right of the chart and selecting + Clone. This will open a new chart creation pane with the same configurations as the original.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bLinking to a dashboard from a tracing project\\nYou can link to any dashboard directly from a tracing project. By default, the prebuilt dashboard for your tracing project is selected. If you have a custom dashboard that you would like to link instead:\\n\\nIn your tracing project, click the three dots next to the Dashboard button.\\nChoose a dashboard to set as the new default.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bExample: user-journey monitoring\\nUse monitoring charts for mapping the decisions made by an agent at a particular node.\\nConsider an email assistant agent. At a particular node it makes a decision about an email to:\\n\\nsend an email back\\nnotify the user\\nno response needed\\n\\nWe can create a chart to track and visualize the breakdown of these decisions.\\nCreating the chart\\n\\n\\nMetric Selection: Select the metric Run count.\\n\\n\\nChart Filters: Add a tree filter to include all of the traces with name triage_input. This means we only include traces that hit the triage_input node. Also add a chart filter for Is Root is true, so our count is not inflated by the number of nodes in the trace.\\n\\n\\n\\nData Series: Create a data series for each decision made at the triage_input node. The output of the decision is stored in the triage.response field of the output object, and the value of the decision is either no, email, or notify. Each of these decisions generates a separate data series in the chart.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow we can visualize the decisions made at the triage_input node over time.\\n\\u200bVideo guide\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSet up online evaluatorsAlerts⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This job will specify the destination, the project, the date range, and filter expression of the data to export. The filter expression is used to narrow down the set of runs exported and is optional. Not setting the filter field will export all runs. Refer to our filter query language and examples to determine the correct filter expression for your export.\\nYou can use the following cURL command to create the job:\\nCopycurl --request POST \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\' \\\\\\n  --data \\'{\\n    \"bulk_export_destination_id\": \"your_destination_id\",\\n    \"session_id\": \"project_uuid\",\\n    \"start_time\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\\n    \"end_time\": \"2024-01-02T23:59:59Z\",\\n    \"filter\": \"and(eq(run_type, \\\\\"llm\\\\\"), eq(name, \\\\\"ChatOpenAI\\\\\"), eq(input_key, \\\\\"messages.content\\\\\"), like(input_value, \\\\\"%messages.content%\\\\\"))\"\\n  }\\'\\n\\nThe session_id is also known as the Tracing Project ID, which can be copied from the individual project view by clicking into the project in the Tracing Projects list.\\nUse the returned id to reference this export in subsequent bulk export operations.\\n\\u200bScheduled exports\\nRequires LangSmith Helm version >= 0.10.42 (application version >= 0.10.109)\\nScheduled exports collect runs periodically and export to the configured destination.\\nTo create a scheduled export, include interval_hours and remove end_time:\\nCopycurl --request POST \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\' \\\\\\n  --data \\'{\\n    \"bulk_export_destination_id\": \"your_destination_id\",\\n    \"session_id\": \"project_uuid\",\\n    \"start_time\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\\n    \"filter\": \"and(eq(run_type, \\\\\"llm\\\\\"), eq(name, \\\\\"ChatOpenAI\\\\\"), eq(input_key, \\\\\"messages.content\\\\\"), like(input_value, \\\\\"%messages.content%\\\\\"))\",\\n    \"interval_hours\": 1\\n  }\\'\\n\\nDetails\\n\\ninterval_hours must be between 1 hour and 168 hours (1 week) inclusive.\\nFor spawned exports, the first time range exported is start_time=(scheduled_export_start_time), end_time=(start_time + interval_hours).\\nThen start_time=(previous_export_end_time), end_time=(this_export_start_time + interval_hours), and so on.\\nend_time must be omitted for scheduled exports. end_time is still required for non-scheduled exports.\\nScheduled exports can be stopped by cancelling the export.\\n\\nExports that have been spawned by a scheduled export have the source_bulk_export_id attribute filled.\\nIf desired, these spawned bulk exports must be canceled separately from the source scheduled bulk export -\\ncanceling the source bulk export does not cancel the spawned bulk exports.\\n\\n\\nSpawned exports run at end_time + 10 minutes to account for any runs that are submitted with end_time in the recent past.\\n\\nExample\\nIf a scheduled bulk export is created with start_time=2025-07-16T00:00:00Z and interval_hours=6:\\nExportStart TimeEnd TimeRuns At12025-07-16T00:00:00Z2025-07-16T06:00:00Z2025-07-16T06:10:00Z22025-07-16T06:00:00Z2025-07-16T12:00:00Z2025-07-16T12:10:00Z32025-07-16T12:00:00Z2025-07-16T18:00:00Z2025-07-16T18:10:00Z\\n\\u200bMonitoring the Export Job\\n\\u200bMonitor Export Status\\nTo monitor the status of an export job, use the following cURL command:\\nCopycurl --request GET \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports/{export_id}\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\'\\n\\nReplace {export_id} with the ID of the export you want to monitor. This command retrieves the current status of the specified export job.\\n\\u200bList Runs for an Export\\nAn export is typically broken up into multiple runs which correspond to a specific date partition to export.\\nTo list all runs associated with a specific export, use the following cURL command:\\nCopycurl --request GET \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports/{export_id}/runs\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\'\\n\\nThis command fetches all runs related to the specified export, providing details such as run ID, status, creation time, rows exported, etc.\\n\\u200bList All Exports\\nTo retrieve a list of all export jobs, use the following cURL command:\\nCopycurl --request GET \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\'\\n\\nThis command returns a list of all export jobs along with their current statuses and creation timestamps.\\n\\u200bStop an Export\\nTo stop an existing export, use the following cURL command:\\nCopycurl --request PATCH \\\\\\n  --url \\'https://api.smith.langchain.com/api/v1/bulk-exports/{export_id}\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\\' \\\\\\n  --header \\'X-Tenant-Id: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID\\' \\\\\\n  --data \\'{\\n    \"status\": \"Cancelled\"\\n}\\'\\n\\nReplace {export_id} with the ID of the export you wish to cancel.

If this is a known error, this will be added to the errors field of the run.\\n\\u200bCommon Errors\\nHere are some common errors:\\nErrorDescriptionAccess deniedThe blob store credentials or bucket are not valid. This error occurs when the provided access key and secret key combination doesn’t have the necessary permissions to access the specified bucket or perform the required operations.Bucket is not validThe specified blob store bucket is not valid. This error is thrown when the bucket doesn’t exist or there is not enough access to perform writes on the bucket.Key ID you provided does not existThe blob store credentials provided are not valid. This error occurs when the access key ID used for authentication is not a valid key.Invalid endpointThe endpoint_url provided is invalid. This error is raised when the specified endpoint is an invalid endpoint. Only S3 compatible endpoints are supported, for example https://storage.googleapis.com for GCS, https://play.min.io for minio, etc. If using AWS, you should omit the endpoint_url.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsView server logs for a traceSet up automation rules⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you are using an asgi app Starlette or FastAPI, you can connect the distributed trace using LangSmith’s TracingMiddleware.\\nThe TracingMiddleware class was added in langsmith==0.1.133.\\nExample using FastAPI:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\nfrom langsmith.middleware import TracingMiddleware\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\\n\\napp = FastAPI()  # Or Flask, Django, or any other framework\\napp.add_middleware(TracingMiddleware)\\n\\n@traceable\\nasync def some_function():\\n    ...\\n\\n@app.post(\"/my-route\")\\nasync def fake_route(request: Request):\\n    return await some_function()\\n\\nOr in Starlette:\\nCopyfrom starlette.applications import Starlette\\nfrom starlette.middleware import Middleware\\nfrom langsmith.middleware import TracingMiddleware\\n\\nroutes = ...\\nmiddleware = [\\n    Middleware(TracingMiddleware),\\n]\\napp = Starlette(..., middleware=middleware)\\n\\nIf you are using other server frameworks, you can always “receive” the distributed trace by passing the headers in through langsmith_extra:\\nCopy# server.py\\nimport langsmith as ls\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\\n\\n@ls.traceable\\nasync def my_application():\\n    ...\\n\\napp = FastAPI()  # Or Flask, Django, or any other framework\\n\\n@app.post(\"/my-route\")\\nasync def fake_route(request: Request):\\n    # request.headers:  {\"langsmith-trace\": \"...\"}\\n    # as well as optional metadata/tags in `baggage`\\n    with ls.tracing_context(parent=request.headers):\\n        return await my_application()\\n\\nThe example above uses the tracing_context context manager. You can also directly specify the parent run context in the langsmith_extra parameter of a method wrapped with @traceable.\\nCopy# ... same as above\\n\\n@app.post(\"/my-route\")\\nasync def fake_route(request: Request):\\n    # request.headers:  {\"langsmith-trace\": \"...\"}\\n    my_application(langsmith_extra={\"parent\": request.headers})\\n\\n\\u200bDistributed tracing in TypeScript\\nDistributed tracing in TypeScript requires langsmith version >=0.1.31\\nFirst, we obtain the current run tree from the client and convert it to langsmith-trace and baggage header values, which we can pass to the server:\\nCopy// client.mts\\nimport { getCurrentRunTree, traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\n\\nconst client = traceable(\\n    async () => {\\n        const runTree = getCurrentRunTree();\\n        return await fetch(\"...\", {\\n            method: \"POST\",\\n            headers: runTree.toHeaders(),\\n        }).then((a) => a.text());\\n    },\\n    { name: \"client\" }\\n);\\n\\nawait client();\\n\\nThen, the server converts the headers back to a run tree, which it uses to further continue the tracing.\\nTo pass the newly created run tree to a traceable function, we can use the withRunTree helper, which will ensure the run tree is propagated within traceable invocations.\\nExpress.JSHonoCopy// server.mts\\nimport { RunTree } from \"langsmith\";\\nimport { traceable, withRunTree } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport express from \"express\";\\nimport bodyParser from \"body-parser\";\\n\\n    const server = traceable(\\n        (text: string) => `Hello from the server!

You can use the filter arguments specified in the filter arguments reference.\\nPrerequisitesInitialize the client before running the below code snippets.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\n\\nclient = Client()\\n\\nBelow are some examples of ways to list runs using keyword arguments:\\n\\u200bList all runs in a project\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyproject_runs = client.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\")\\n\\n\\u200bList LLM and Chat runs in the last 24 hours\\nPythonTypeScriptCopytodays_llm_runs = client.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1),\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bList root runs in a project\\nRoot runs are runs that have no parents. These are assigned a value of True for is_root. You can use this to filter for root runs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyroot_runs = client.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    is_root=True\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bList runs without errors\\nPythonTypeScriptCopycorrect_runs = client.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", error=False)\\n\\n\\u200bList runs by run ID\\nIgnores Other ArgumentsIf you provide a list of run IDs in the way described above, it will ignore all other filtering arguments like project_name, run_type, etc. and directly return the runs matching the given IDs.\\nIf you have a list of run IDs, you can list them directly:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyrun_ids = [\\'a36092d2-4ad5-4fb4-9c0d-0dba9a2ed836\\',\\'9398e6be-964f-4aa4-8ae9-ad78cd4b7074\\']\\nselected_runs = client.list_runs(id=run_ids)\\n\\n\\u200bUse filter query language\\nFor more complex queries, you can use the query language described in the filter query language reference.\\n\\u200bList all root runs in a conversational thread\\nThis is the way to fetch runs in a conversational thread. For more information on setting up threads, refer to our how-to guide on setting up threads.\\nThreads are grouped by setting a shared thread ID. The LangSmith UI lets you use any one of the following three metadata keys: session_id, conversation_id, or thread_id. The session ID is also known as the tracing project ID. The following query matches on any of them.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopygroup_key = \"<your_thread_id>\"\\nfilter_string = f\\'and(in(metadata_key, [\"session_id\",\"conversation_id\",\"thread_id\"]), eq(metadata_value, \"{group_key}\"))\\'\\nthread_runs = client.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    filter=filter_string,\\n    is_root=True\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs called “extractor” whose root of the trace was assigned feedback “user_score” score of 1\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    filter=\\'eq(name, \"extractor\")\\',\\n    trace_filter=\\'and(eq(feedback_key, \"user_score\"), eq(feedback_score, 1))\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bList runs with “star_rating” key whose score is greater than 4\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    filter=\\'and(eq(feedback_key, \"star_rating\"), gt(feedback_score, 4))\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bList runs that took longer than 5 seconds to complete\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", filter=\\'gt(latency, \"5s\")\\')\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs that have “error” not equal to null\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", filter=\\'neq(error, null)\\')\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs where start_time is greater than a specific timestamp\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", filter=\\'gt(start_time, \"2023-07-15T12:34:56Z\")\\')\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs that contain the string “substring”\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", filter=\\'search(\"substring\")\\')\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs that are tagged with the git hash “2aa1cf4”\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(project_name=\"<your_project>\", filter=\\'has(tags, \"2aa1cf4\")\\')\\n\\n\\u200bList all runs that started after a specific timestamp and either have “error” not equal to null or a “Correctness” feedback score equal to 0\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n  filter=\\'and(gt(start_time, \"2023-07-15T12:34:56Z\"), or(neq(error, null), and(eq(feedback_key, \"Correctness\"), eq(feedback_score, 0.0))))\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bComplex query: List all runs where tags include “experimental” or “beta” and latency is greater than 2 seconds\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n  filter=\\'and(or(has(tags, \"experimental\"), has(tags, \"beta\")), gt(latency, 2))\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bSearch trace trees by full text\\nYou can use the search() function without any specific field to do a full text search across all string fields in a run. This allows you to quickly find traces that match a search term.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n  filter=\\'search(\"image classification\")\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCheck for presence of metadata\\nIf you want to check for the presence of metadata, you can use the eq operator, optionally with an and statement to match by value. This is useful if you want to log more structured information about your runs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyto_search = {\\n    \"user_id\": \"\"\\n}\\n\\n# Check for any run with the \"user_id\" metadata key\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"eq(metadata_key, \\'user_id\\')\"\\n)\\n# Check for runs with user_id=4070f233-f61e-44eb-bff1-da3c163895a3\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(eq(metadata_key, \\'user_id\\'), eq(metadata_value, \\'4070f233-f61e-44eb-bff1-da3c163895a3\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCheck for environment details in metadata\\nA common pattern is to add environment information to your traces via metadata. If you want to filter for runs containing environment metadata, you can use the same pattern as above:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(eq(metadata_key, \\'environment\\'), eq(metadata_value, \\'production\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCheck for conversation ID in metadata\\nAnother common way to associate traces in the same conversation is by using a shared conversation ID. If you want to filter runs based on a conversation ID in this way, you can search for that ID in the metadata.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(eq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'), eq(metadata_value, \\'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bNegative filtering on key-value pairs\\nYou can use negative filtering on metadata, input, and output key-value pairs to exclude specific runs from your results. Here are some examples for metadata key-value pairs but the same logic applies to input and output key-value pairs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# Find all runs where the metadata does not contain a \"conversation_id\" key\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(neq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n# Find all runs where the conversation_id in metadata is not \"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\"\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(eq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'), neq(metadata_value, \\'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n# Find all runs where there is no \"conversation_id\" metadata key and the \"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\" value is not present\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(neq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'), neq(metadata_value, \\'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n# Find all runs where the conversation_id metadata key is not present but the \"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\" value is present\\nclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(neq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'), eq(metadata_value, \\'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bCombine multiple filters\\nIf you want to combine multiple conditions to refine your search, you can use the and operator along with other filtering functions. Here’s how you can search for runs named “ChatOpenAI” that also have a specific conversation_id in their metadata:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n  project_name=\"default\",\\n  filter=\"and(eq(name, \\'ChatOpenAI\\'), eq(metadata_key, \\'conversation_id\\'), eq(metadata_value, \\'69b12c91-b1e2-46ce-91de-794c077e8151\\'))\"\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bTree Filter\\nList all runs named “RetrieveDocs” whose root run has a “user_score” feedback of 1 and any run in the full trace is named “ExpandQuery”.\\nThis type of query is useful if you want to extract a specific run conditional on various states or steps being reached within the trace.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyclient.list_runs(\\n    project_name=\"<your_project>\",\\n    filter=\\'eq(name, \"RetrieveDocs\")\\',\\n    trace_filter=\\'and(eq(feedback_key, \"user_score\"), eq(feedback_score, 1))\\',\\n    tree_filter=\\'eq(name, \"ExpandQuery\")\\'\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bAdvanced: export flattened trace view with child tool usage\\nThe following Python example demonstrates how to export a flattened view of traces, including information on the tools (from nested runs) used by the agent within each trace.\\nThis can be used to analyze the behavior of your agents across multiple traces.\\nThis example queries all tool runs within a specified number of days and groups them by their parent (root) run ID. It then fetches the relevant information for each root run, such as the run name, inputs, outputs, and combines that information with the child run information.\\nTo optimize the query, the example:\\n\\nSelects only the necessary fields when querying tool runs to reduce query time.\\nFetches root runs in batches while processing tool runs concurrently.\\n\\nPythonCopyfrom collections import defaultdict\\nfrom concurrent.futures import Future, ThreadPoolExecutor\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nproject_name = \"my-project\"\\nnum_days = 30\\n\\n# List all tool runs\\ntool_runs = client.list_runs(\\n    project_name=project_name,\\n    start_time=datetime.now() -

Filters are used for effectively navigating and analyzing this data, allowing you to:\\n\\nHave focused investigations: Quickly narrow down to specific runs for ad-hoc analysis\\nDebug and analyze: Identify and examine errors, failed runs, and performance bottlenecks\\n\\nThis page contains a series of guides for how to filter runs in a tracing project. If you are programmatically exporting runs for analysis via the API or SDK, please refer to the exporting traces guide for more information.\\n\\u200bCreating and Applying Filters\\n\\u200bFiltering by run attributes\\nThere are two ways to filter runs in a tracing project:\\n\\nFilters: Located towards the top-left of the tracing projects page. This is where you construct and manage detailed filter criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter Shortcuts: Positioned on the right sidebar of the tracing projects page. The filter shortcuts bar provides quick access to filters based on the most frequently occurring attributes in your project’s runs.\\n\\n\\nDefault filterBy default, the IsTrace is true filter is applied. This displays only top-level traces. Removing this filter will show all runs, including intermediate spans, in the project.\\n\\u200bFiltering by time range\\nIn addition to filtering by run attributes, you can also filter runs within a specific time range. This option is available towards the top-left of the tracing projects page.\\n\\n\\u200bFilter operators\\nThe available filter operators depend on the data type of the attribute you are filtering on. Here’s an overview of common operators:\\n\\nis: Exact match on the filter value\\nis not: Negative match on the filter value\\ncontains: Partial match on the filter value\\ndoes not contain: Negative partial match on the filter value\\nis one of: Match on any of the values in the list\\n> / <: Available for numeric fields\\n\\n\\u200bSpecific Filtering Techniques\\n\\u200bFilter for intermediate runs (spans)\\nIn order to filter for intermediate runs (spans), you first need to remove the default IsTrace is true filter. For example, you would do this if you wanted to filter by run name for sub runs or filter by run type.\\nRun metadata and tags are also powerful to filter on. These rely on good tagging across all parts of your pipeline. To learn more, you can check out this guide.\\n\\u200bFilter based on inputs and outputs\\nYou can filter runs based on the content in the inputs and outputs of the run.\\nTo filter either inputs or outputs, you can use the Full-Text Search filter which will match keywords in either field. For more targeted search, you can use the Input or Output filters which will only match content based on the respective field.\\nFor performance, we index up to 250 characters of data for full-text search. If your search query exceeds this limit, we recommend using Input/Output key-value search instead.\\nYou can also specify multiple matches, either by including multiple terms separated by whitespace, or adding multiple filters - which will try to match all terms provided.\\nNote that keyword search is done by splitting the text and finding any partial matches on the search keywords, so it is not done in specific order. We exclude common stop words from the search (from the nltk stop word list along with a few other common JSON keywords).\\n\\nBased on the filters above, the system will search for python and tensorflow in either inputs or outputs, and embedding in the inputs along with fine and tune in the outputs.\\n\\u200bFilter based on input / output key-value pairs\\nIn addition to full-text search, you can filter runs based on specific key-value pairs in the inputs and outputs. This allows for more precise filtering, especially when dealing with structured data.\\nWe index up to 100 unique keys to keep your data organized and searchable. Each key also has a character limit of 250 characters per value. If your data exceeds either of these limits, the text won’t be indexed. This helps us ensure fast, reliable performance.\\nTo filter based on key-value pairs, select the Input Key or Output Key filter from the filters dropdown.\\nFor example, to match the following input:\\nCopy{\\n  \"input\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\\n}\\n\\nSelect Filters, Add Filter to bring up the filtering options. Then select Input Key, enter input as the key and enter What is the capital of France? as the value.\\n\\nYou can also match nested keys by using dot notation to select the nested key name. For example, to match nested keys in the output:\\nCopy{\\n  \"documents\": [\\n    {\\n      \"page_content\": \"The capital of France is Paris\",\\n      \"metadata\": {},\\n      \"type\": \"Document\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nSelect Output Key, enter documents.page_content as the key and enter The capital of France is Paris as the value. This will match the nested key documents.page_content with the specified value.\\n\\nYou can add multiple key-value filters to create more complex queries. You can also use the Filter Shortcuts on the right side to quickly filter based on common key-value pairs as shown below:\\n\\n\\u200bExample: Filtering for tool calls\\nIt’s common to want to search for traces that contain specific tool calls. Tool calls are typically indicated in the output of an LLM run. To filter for tool calls, you would use the Output Key filter.\\nWhile this example will show you how to filter for tool calls, the same logic can be applied to filter for any key-value pair in the output.\\nIn this case, let’s assume this is the output you want to filter for:\\nCopy{\\n  \"generations\": [\\n    [\\n      {\\n        \"text\": \"\",\\n        \"type\": \"ChatGeneration\",\\n        \"message\": {\\n          \"lc\": 1,\\n          \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n          \"id\": [],\\n          \"kwargs\": {\\n            \"type\": \"ai\",\\n            \"id\": \"run-ca7f7531-f4de-4790-9c3e-960be7f8b109\",\\n            \"tool_calls\": [\\n              {\\n                \"name\": \"Plan\",\\n                \"args\": {\\n                  \"steps\": [\\n                    \"Research LangGraph\\'s node configuration capabilities\",\\n                    \"Investigate how to add a Python code execution node\",\\n                    \"Find an example or create a sample implementation of a code execution node\"\\n                  ]\\n                },\\n                \"id\": \"toolu_01XexPzAVknT3gRmUB5PK5BP\",\\n                \"type\": \"tool_call\"\\n              }\\n            ]\\n          }\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  ],\\n  \"llm_output\": null,\\n  \"run\": null,\\n  \"type\": \"LLMResult\"\\n}\\n\\nWith the example above, the KV search will map each nested JSON path as a key-value pair that you can use to search and filter.\\nLangSmith will break it into the following set of searchable key-value pairs:\\nKeyValuegenerations.typeChatGenerationgenerations.message.typeconstructorgenerations.message.kwargs.typeaigenerations.message.kwargs.idrun-ca7f7531-f4de-4790-9c3e-960be7f8b109generations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.namePlangenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.args.stepsResearch LangGraph\\'s node configuration capabilitiesgenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.args.stepsInvestigate how to add a Python code execution nodegenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.args.stepsFind an example or create a sample implementation of a code execution nodegenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.idtoolu_01XexPzAVknT3gRmUB5PK5BPgenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.typetool_calltypeLLMResult\\nTo search for a specific tool call, you can use the following Output Key search while removing the root runs filter:\\ngenerations.message.kwargs.tool_calls.name = Plan\\nThis will match root and non-root runs where the tool_calls name is Plan.\\n\\n\\u200bNegative filtering on key-value pairs\\nDifferent types of negative filtering can be applied to Metadata, Input Key, and Output Key fields to exclude specific runs from your results.\\nFor example, to find all runs where the metadata key phone is not equal to 1234567890, set the Metadata Key operator to is and Key field to phone, then set the Value operator to is not and the Value field to 1234567890. This will match all runs that have a metadata key phone with any value except 1234567890.\\n\\nTo find runs that don’t have a specific metadata key, set the Key operator to is not. For example, setting the Key operator to is not with phone as the key will match all runs that don’t have a phone field in their metadata.\\n\\nYou can also filter for runs that neither have a specific key nor a specific value. To find runs where the metadata has neither the key phone nor any field with the value 1234567890, set the Key operator to is not with key phone, and the Value operator to is not with value 1234567890.\\n\\nFinally, you can also filter for runs that do not have a specific key but have a specific value. To find runs where there is no phone key but there is a value of 1234567890 for some other key, set the Key operator to is not with key phone, and the Value operator to is with value 1234567890.\\n\\nNote that you can use the does not contain operator instead of is not to perform a substring match.\\n\\u200bSave a filter\\nSaving filters allows you to store and reuse frequently used filter configurations. Saved filters are specific to a tracing project.\\n\\u200bSave a filter\\nIn the filter box, click the Save filter button after you have constructed your filter. This will bring up a dialog to specify the name and a description of the filter.\\n\\n\\u200bUse a saved filter\\nAfter saving a filter, it is available in the filter bar as a quick filter for you to use. If you have more than three saved filters, only two will be displayed directly, with the rest accessible via a “more” menu. You can use the settings icon in the saved filter bar to optionally hide default saved filters.\\n\\n\\u200bUpdate a saved filter\\nWith the filter selected, make any changes to filter parameters. Then click Update filter > Update to update the filter.\\nIn the same menu, you can also create a new saved filter by clicking Update filter > Create new.\\n\\u200bDelete a saved filter\\nClick the settings icon in the saved filter bar, and delete a filter using the trash icon.\\n\\u200bCopy a filter\\nYou can copy a constructed filter to share it with colleagues, reuse it later, or query runs programmatically in the API or SDK.\\nIn order to copy the filter, you can first create it in the UI. From there, you can click the copy button in the upper right hand corner. If you have constructed tree or trace filters, you can also copy those.\\nThis will give you a string representing the filter in the LangSmith query language. For example: and(eq(is_root, true), and(eq(feedback_key, \"user_score\"), eq(feedback_score, 1))). For more information on the query language syntax, please refer to this reference.\\n\\n\\u200bFiltering runs within the trace view\\nYou can also apply filters directly within the trace view, which is useful for sifting through traces with a large number of runs. The same filters available in the main runs table view can be applied here.\\nBy default, only the runs that match the filters will be shown. To see the matched runs within the broader context of the trace tree, switch the view option from “Filtered Only” to “Show All” or “Most relevant”.\\n\\n\\u200bManually specify a raw query in LangSmith query language\\nIf you have copied a previously constructed filter, you may want to manually apply this raw query in a future session.\\nIn order to do this, you can click on Advanced filters on the bottom of the filters popover. From there you can paste a raw query into the text box.\\nNote that this will add that query to the existing queries, not overwrite it.\\n\\n\\u200bUse an AI Query to auto-generate a query (Experimental)\\nSometimes figuring out the exact query to specify can be difficult! In order to make it easier, we’ve added an AI Query functionality. With this, you can type in the filter you want to construct in natural language and it will convert it into a valid query.\\nFor example: “All runs longer than 10 seconds”\\n\\n\\u200bAdvanced filters\\n\\u200bFilter for intermediate runs (spans) on properties of the root\\nA common concept is to filter for intermediate runs which are part of a trace whose root run has some attribute. An example is filtering for intermediate runs of a particular type whose root run has positive (or negative) feedback associated with it.\\nIn order to do this, first set up a filter for intermediate runs (per the above section). After that, you can then add another filter rule. You can then click the Advanced Filters link all the way at the bottom of the filter. This will open up a new modal where you can add Trace filters. These filters will apply to the traces of all the parent runs of the individual runs you’ve already filtered for.\\n\\n\\u200bFilter for runs (spans) whose child runs have some attribute\\nThis is the opposite of the above. You may want to search for runs who have specific types of sub runs. An example of this could be searching for all traces that had a sub run with name Foo. This is useful when Foo is not always called, but you want to analyze the cases where it is.\\nIn order to do this, you can click on the Advanced Filters link all the way at the bottom of the filter. This will open up a new modal where you can add Tree filters. This will make the rule you specify apply to all child runs of the individual runs you’ve already filtered for.\\n\\n\\u200bExample: Filtering on all runs whose tree contains the tool call filter\\nExtending the tool call filtering example from above, if you would like to filter for all runs whose tree contains the tool filter call, you can use the tree filter in the advanced filters setting:\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsBeta LangSmith Collector-ProxyQuery traces (SDK)⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

However, the data will not be processed or rendered in a way that is specific to LLMs.\\nLangSmith provides special rendering and processing for LLM traces, including token counting (assuming token counts are not available from the model provider) and token-based cost calculation. In order to make the most of this feature, you must log your LLM traces in a specific format.\\nThe examples below uses the traceable decorator/wrapper to log the model run (which is the recommended approach for Python and JS/TS). However, the same idea applies if you are using the RunTree or API directly.\\n\\u200bChat-style models\\n\\u200bUsing LangChain OSS or LangSmith wrappers\\nIf you are using LangChain OSS or LangSmith wrappers, you don’t need to do anything special. The wrappers will automatically log traces in the correct format.\\n\\u200bImplementing your own custom chat-model\\nIf you are implementing your own custom chat-model, you need to ensure that your inputs contain a key messages with a list of dictionaries/objects. Each dictionary/object must contain the keys role and content with string values. The output must return an object that, when serialized, contains the key choices with a list of dictionaries/objects. Each must contain the key message with a dictionary/object that contains the keys role and content with string values.\\nTo make your custom LLM traces appear well-formatted in the LangSmith UI, your trace inputs and outputs must conform to a format LangSmith recognizes:\\n\\n\\nA list of messages in OpenAI or Anthropic format, represented as Python dictionaries or TypeScript objects.\\n\\nEach message must contain the key role and content.\\n\\nMessages with the \"assistant\" role may optionally contain tool_calls. These tool_calls may be in OpenAI format or LangChain’s format.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn dict/object containing \"messages\" key with a list of messages in the above format.\\n\\nLangSmith may use additional parameters in this input dict that match OpenAI’s chat completion endpoint for rendering in the trace view, such as a list of available tools for the model to call.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some examples:\\nList of messagesMessages dictCopy# Format 1: List of messages\\ninputs = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What\\'s the weather like?\"},\\n    {\\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n        \"content\": \"I need to check the weather for you.\",\\n        \"tool_calls\": [\\n            {\\n                \"id\": \"call_123\",\\n                \"type\": \"function\",\\n                \"function\": {\\n                    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\\n                    \"arguments\": \\'{\"location\": \"current\"}\\'\\n                }\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n]\\n\\n@traceable(run_type=\"llm\")\\ndef chat_model(messages: list):\\n    ...\\n\\nchat_model(inputs)\\n\\nThe output is accepted in any of the following formats:\\n\\nA dictionary/object that contains the key choices with a value that is a list of dictionaries/objects. Each dictionary/object must contain the key message, which maps to a message object with the keys role and content.\\nA dictionary/object that contains the key message with a value that is a message object with the keys role and content.\\nA tuple/array of two elements, where the first element is the role and the second element is the content.\\nA dictionary/object that contains the key role and content.\\n\\nHere are some examples:\\nChoices formatMessage formatTuple formatDirect formatCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\n@traceable(run_type=\"llm\")\\ndef chat_model_choices(messages):\\n    # Your model logic here\\n    return {\\n        \"choices\": [\\n            {\\n                \"message\": {\\n                    \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n                    \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n                }\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n\\n# Usage\\ninputs = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I\\'d like to book a table for two.\"}\\n]\\nchat_model_choices(inputs)\\n\\nYou can also provide the following metadata fields to help LangSmith identify the model - which if recognized, LangSmith will use to automatically calculate costs. To learn more about how to use the metadata fields, see this guide.\\n\\nls_provider: The provider of the model, eg “openai”, “anthropic”, etc.\\nls_model_name: The name of the model, eg “gpt-4o-mini”, “claude-3-opus-20240307”, etc.\\n\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\ninputs = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I\\'d like to book a table for two.\"},\\n]\\noutput = {\\n    \"choices\": [\\n        {\\n            \"message\": {\\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n                \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n            }\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n\\n# Can also use one of:\\n# output = {\\n#     \"message\": {\\n#         \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n#         \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n#     }\\n# }\\n#\\n# output = {\\n#     \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n#     \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n# }\\n#\\n# output = [\"assistant\", \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"]\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n    metadata={\"ls_provider\": \"my_provider\", \"ls_model_name\": \"my_model\"}\\n)\\ndef chat_model(messages: list):\\n    return output\\n\\nchat_model(inputs)\\n\\nThe above code will log the following trace:\\n\\nIf you implement a custom streaming chat_model, you can “reduce” the outputs into the same format as the non-streaming version. This is currently only supported in Python.\\nCopydef _reduce_chunks(chunks: list):\\n    all_text = \"\".join([chunk[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"] for chunk in chunks])\\n    return {\"choices\": [{\"message\": {\"content\": all_text, \"role\": \"assistant\"}}]}\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n    reduce_fn=_reduce_chunks,\\n    metadata={\"ls_provider\": \"my_provider\", \"ls_model_name\": \"my_model\"}\\n)\\ndef my_streaming_chat_model(messages: list):\\n    for chunk in [\"Hello, \" + messages[1][\"content\"]]:\\n        yield {\\n            \"choices\": [\\n                {\\n                    \"message\": {\\n                        \"content\": chunk,\\n                        \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            ]\\n        }\\n\\nlist(\\n    my_streaming_chat_model(\\n        [\\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant. Please greet the user.\"},\\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"polly the parrot\"},\\n        ],\\n    )\\n)\\n\\nIf ls_model_name is not present in extra.metadata, other fields might be used from the extra.metadata for estimating token counts. The following fields are used in the order of precedence:\\nmetadata.ls_model_name\\ninputs.model\\ninputs.model_name\\n\\n\\u200bProvide token and cost information\\nBy default, LangSmith uses tiktoken to count tokens, utilizing a best guess at the model’s tokenizer based on the ls_model_name provided. It also calculates costs automatically by using the model pricing table. To learn how LangSmith calculates token-based costs, see this guide.\\nHowever, many models already include exact token counts as part of the response. If you have this information, you can override the default token calculation in LangSmith in one of two ways:\\n\\nExtract usage within your traced function and set a usage_metadata field on the run’s metadata.\\nReturn a usage_metadata field in your traced function outputs.\\n\\nIn both cases, the usage metadata you send should contain a subset of the following LangSmith-recognized fields:\\nYou cannot set any fields other than the ones listed below. You do not need to include all fields.\\nCopyclass UsageMetadata(TypedDict, total=False):\\n    input_tokens: int\\n    \"\"\"The number of tokens used for the prompt.\"\"\"\\n    output_tokens: int\\n    \"\"\"The number of tokens generated as output.\"\"\"\\n    total_tokens: int\\n    \"\"\"The total number of tokens used.\"\"\"\\n    input_token_details: dict[str, float]\\n    \"\"\"The details of the input tokens.\"\"\"\\n    output_token_details: dict[str, float]\\n    \"\"\"The details of the output tokens.\"\"\"\\n    input_cost: float\\n    \"\"\"The cost of the input tokens.\"\"\"\\n    output_cost: float\\n    \"\"\"The cost of the output tokens.\"\"\"\\n    total_cost: float\\n    \"\"\"The total cost of the tokens.\"\"\"\\n    input_cost_details: dict[str, float]\\n    \"\"\"The cost details of the input tokens.\"\"\"\\n    output_cost_details: dict[str, float]\\n    \"\"\"The cost details of the output tokens.\"\"\"\\n\\nNote that the usage data can also include cost information, in case you do not want to rely on LangSmith’s token-based cost formula. This is useful for models with pricing that is not linear by token type.\\n\\u200bSetting run metadata\\nYou can modify the current run’s metadata with usage information within your traced function. The advantage of this approach is that you do not need to change your traced function’s runtime outputs. Here’s an example:\\nRequires langsmith>=0.3.43 (Python) and langsmith>=0.3.30 (JS/TS).\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable, get_current_run_tree\\n\\ninputs = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I\\'d like to book a table for two.\"},\\n]\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n    metadata={\"ls_provider\": \"my_provider\", \"ls_model_name\": \"my_model\"}\\n)\\ndef chat_model(messages: list):\\n    llm_output = {\\n        \"choices\": [\\n            {\\n                \"message\": {\\n                    \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n                    \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n                }\\n            }\\n        ],\\n        \"usage_metadata\": {\\n            \"input_tokens\": 27,\\n            \"output_tokens\": 13,\\n            \"total_tokens\": 40,\\n            \"input_token_details\": {\"cache_read\": 10},\\n            # If you wanted to specify costs:\\n            # \"input_cost\": 1.1e-6,\\n            # \"input_cost_details\": {\"cache_read\": 2.3e-7},\\n            # \"output_cost\": 5.0e-6,\\n        },\\n    }\\n    run = get_current_run_tree()\\n    run.set(usage_metadata=llm_output[\"usage_metadata\"])\\n    return llm_output[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"]\\n\\nchat_model(inputs)\\n\\n\\u200bSetting run outputs\\nYou can add a usage_metadata key to the function’s response to set manual token counts and costs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\ninputs = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I\\'d like to book a table for two.\"},\\n]\\noutput = {\\n    \"choices\": [\\n        {\\n            \"message\": {\\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n                \"content\": \"Sure, what time would you like to book the table for?\"\\n            }\\n        }\\n    ],\\n    \"usage_metadata\": {\\n        \"input_tokens\": 27,\\n        \"output_tokens\": 13,\\n        \"total_tokens\": 40,\\n        \"input_token_details\": {\"cache_read\": 10},\\n        # If you wanted to specify costs:\\n        # \"input_cost\": 1.1e-6,\\n        # \"input_cost_details\": {\"cache_read\": 2.3e-7},\\n        # \"output_cost\": 5.0e-6,\\n    },\\n}\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n    metadata={\"ls_provider\": \"my_provider\", \"ls_model_name\": \"my_model\"}\\n)\\ndef chat_model(messages: list):\\n    return output\\n\\nchat_model(inputs)\\n\\n\\u200bTime-to-first-token\\nIf you are using traceable or one of our SDK wrappers, LangSmith will automatically populate time-to-first-token for streaming LLM runs.\\nHowever, if you are using the RunTree API directly, you will need to add a new_token event to the run tree in order to properly populate time-to-first-token.\\nHere’s an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith.run_trees import RunTree\\nrun_tree = RunTree(\\n    name=\"CustomChatModel\",\\n    run_type=\"llm\",\\n    inputs={ ... }\\n)\\nrun_tree.post()\\nllm_stream = ...\\nfirst_token = None\\nfor token in llm_stream:\\n    if first_token is None:\\n      first_token = token\\n      run_tree.add_event({\\n        \"name\": \"new_token\"\\n      })\\nrun_tree.end(outputs={ ... })\\nrun_tree.patch()\\n\\n\\u200bInstruct-style models\\nFor instruct-style models (string in, string out), your inputs must contain a key prompt with a string value. Other inputs are also permitted. The output must return an object that, when serialized, contains the key choices with a list of dictionaries/objects. Each must contain the key text with a string value.

In these cases, you’ll want to include multimodal content in your prompt and test the model’s ability to answer questions about the content.\\nThe LangSmith Playground supports two methods for incorporating multimodal content in your prompts:\\n\\n\\nInline content: Embed static files (images, PDFs, audio) directly in your prompt. This is ideal when you want to consistently include the same multimodal content across all uses of the prompt. For example, you might include a reference image that helps ground the model’s responses.\\n\\n\\nTemplate variables: Create dynamic placeholders for attachments that can be populated with different content each time. This approach offers more flexibility, allowing you to:\\n\\nTest how the model handles different inputs\\nCreate reusable prompts that work with varying content\\n\\n\\n\\nNot all models support multimodal content. Before using multimodal features in the playground, make sure your selected model supports the file types you want to use.\\n\\u200bInline content\\nClick the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content.

However, the data will not be rendered in a way that is specific to retriever steps.\\nMany LLM applications require looking up documents from vector databases, knowledge graphs, or other types of indexes. Retriever traces are a way to log the documents that are retrieved by the retriever. LangSmith provides special rendering for retrieval steps in traces to make it easier to understand and diagnose retrieval issues.

LangSmith provides a way to filter the inputs and outputs of your traces before they are sent to the LangSmith backend.\\nIf you want to completely hide the inputs and outputs of your traces, you can set the following environment variables when running your application:\\nCopyLANGSMITH_HIDE_INPUTS=true\\nLANGSMITH_HIDE_OUTPUTS=true\\n\\nThis works for both the LangSmith SDK (Python and TypeScript) and LangChain.\\nYou can also customize and override this behavior for a given Client instance. This can be done by setting the hide_inputs and hide_outputs parameters on the Client object (hideInputs and hideOutputs in TypeScript).\\nFor the example below, we will simply return an empty object for both hide_inputs and hide_outputs, but you can customize this to your needs.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport openai\\nfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\n\\nopenai_client = wrap_openai(openai.Client())\\nlangsmith_client = Client(\\n    hide_inputs=lambda inputs: {}, hide_outputs=lambda outputs: {}\\n)\\n\\n# The trace produced will have its metadata present, but the inputs will be hidden\\nopenai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n    messages=[\\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\\n    ],\\n    langsmith_extra={\"client\": langsmith_client},\\n)\\n\\n# The trace produced will not have hidden inputs and outputs\\nopenai_client.chat.completions.create(\\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n    messages=[\\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"},\\n    ],\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bRule-based masking of inputs and outputs\\nThis feature is available in the following LangSmith SDK versions:\\nPython: 0.1.81 and above\\nTypeScript: 0.1.33 and above\\n\\nTo mask specific data in inputs and outputs, you can use the create_anonymizer / createAnonymizer function and pass the newly created anonymizer when instantiating the client. The anonymizer can be either constructed from a list of regex patterns and the replacement values or from a function that accepts and returns a string value.\\nThe anonymizer will be skipped for inputs if LANGSMITH_HIDE_INPUTS = true. Same applies for outputs if LANGSMITH_HIDE_OUTPUTS = true.\\nHowever, if inputs or outputs are to be sent to client, the anonymizer method will take precedence over functions found in hide_inputs and hide_outputs. By default, the create_anonymizer will only look at maximum of 10 nesting levels deep, which can be configured via the max_depth parameter.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith.anonymizer import create_anonymizer\\nfrom langsmith import Client, traceable\\nimport re\\n\\n# create anonymizer from list of regex patterns and replacement values\\nanonymizer = create_anonymizer([\\n    { \"pattern\": r\"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\", \"replace\": \"<email-address>\" },\\n    { \"pattern\": r\"[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}\", \"replace\": \"<UUID>\" }\\n])\\n\\n# or create anonymizer from a function\\nemail_pattern = re.compile(r\"[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\")\\nuuid_pattern = re.compile(r\"[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}\")\\nanonymizer = create_anonymizer(\\n    lambda text: email_pattern.sub(\"<email-address>\", uuid_pattern.sub(\"<UUID>\", text))\\n)\\n\\nclient = Client(anonymizer=anonymizer)\\n\\n@traceable(client=client)\\ndef main(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    ...\\n\\nPlease note, that using the anonymizer might incur a performance hit with complex regular expressions or large payloads, as the anonymizer serializes the payload to JSON before processing.\\nImproving the performance of anonymizer API is on our roadmap! If you are encountering performance issues, please contact us at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\nOlder versions of LangSmith SDKs can use the hide_inputs and hide_outputs parameters to achieve the same effect.

This is useful for reducing payload size, removing sensitive information, or customizing how an object should be serialized and represented in LangSmith for a particular function.\\nHere’s an example of how to use process_inputs and process_outputs:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\ndef process_inputs(inputs: dict) -> dict:\\n    # inputs is a dictionary where keys are argument names and values are the provided arguments\\n    # Return a new dictionary with processed inputs\\n    return {\\n        \"processed_key\": inputs.get(\"my_cool_key\", \"default\"),\\n        \"length\": len(inputs.get(\"my_cool_key\", \"\"))\\n    }\\n\\ndef process_outputs(output: Any) -> dict:\\n    # output is the direct return value of the function\\n    # Transform the output into a dictionary\\n    # In this case, \"output\" will be an integer\\n    return {\"processed_output\": str(output)}\\n\\n@traceable(process_inputs=process_inputs, process_outputs=process_outputs)\\ndef my_function(my_cool_key: str) -> int:\\n    # Function implementation\\n    return len(my_cool_key)\\n\\nresult = my_function(\"example\")\\n\\nIn this example, process_inputs creates a new dictionary with processed input data, and process_outputs transforms the output into a specific format before logging to LangSmith.\\nIt’s recommended to avoid mutating the source objects in the processor functions. Instead, create and return new objects with the processed data.\\nFor asynchronous functions, the usage is similar:\\nCopy@traceable(process_inputs=process_inputs, process_outputs=process_outputs)\\nasync def async_function(key: str) -> int:\\n    # Async implementation\\n    return len(key)\\n\\nThese function-level processors take precedence over client-level processors (hide_inputs and hide_outputs) when both are defined.\\n\\u200bQuick starts\\nYou can combine rule-based masking with various anonymizers to scrub sensitive information from inputs and outputs.

This is because Python’s asyncio only added full support for passing context in version 3.11.\\n\\u200bWhy\\nLangChain and LangSmith SDK use contextvars to propagate tracing information implicitly. In Python 3.11 and above, this works seamlessly. However, in earlier versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10), asyncio tasks lack proper contextvar support, which can lead to disconnected traces.\\n\\u200bTo resolve\\n\\n\\nUpgrade Python Version (Recommended) If possible, upgrade to Python 3.11 or later for automatic context propagation.\\n\\n\\nManual Context Propagation If upgrading isn’t an option, you’ll need to manually propagate the tracing context. The method varies depending on your setup:\\na) Using LangGraph or LangChain Pass the parent config to the child call:\\nCopyimport asyncio\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, RunnableLambda\\n\\n@RunnableLambda\\nasync def my_child_runnable(\\n    inputs: str,\\n    # The config arg (present in parent_runnable below) is optional\\n):\\n    yield \"A\"\\n    yield \"response\"\\n\\n@RunnableLambda\\nasync def parent_runnable(inputs: str, config: RunnableConfig):\\n    async for chunk in my_child_runnable.astream(inputs, config):\\n        yield chunk\\n\\nasync def main():\\n    return [val async for val in parent_runnable.astream(\"call\")]\\n\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n\\nb) Using LangSmith Directly Pass the run tree directly:\\nCopyimport asyncio\\nimport langsmith as ls\\n\\n@ls.traceable\\nasync def my_child_function(inputs: str):\\n    yield \"A\"\\n    yield \"response\"\\n\\n@ls.traceable\\nasync def parent_function(\\n    inputs: str,\\n    # The run tree can be auto-populated by the decorator\\n    run_tree: ls.RunTree,\\n):\\n    async for chunk in my_child_function(inputs, langsmith_extra={\"parent\": run_tree}):\\n        yield chunk\\n\\nasync def main():\\n    return [val async for val in parent_function(\"call\")]\\n\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n\\nc) Combining Decorated Code with LangGraph/LangChain Use a combination of techniques for manual handoff:\\nCopyimport asyncio\\nimport langsmith as ls\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, RunnableLambda\\n\\n@RunnableLambda\\nasync def my_child_runnable(inputs: str):\\n    yield \"A\"\\n    yield \"response\"\\n\\n@ls.traceable\\nasync def my_child_function(inputs: str, run_tree: ls.RunTree):\\n    with ls.tracing_context(parent=run_tree):\\n        async for chunk in my_child_runnable.astream(inputs):\\n            yield chunk\\n\\n@RunnableLambda\\nasync def parent_runnable(inputs: str, config: RunnableConfig):\\n    # @traceable decorated functions can directly accept a RunnableConfig when passed in via \"config\"\\n    async for chunk in my_child_function(inputs, langsmith_extra={\"config\": config}):\\n        yield chunk\\n\\n@ls.traceable\\nasync def parent_function(inputs: str, run_tree: ls.RunTree):\\n    # You can set the tracing context manually\\n    with ls.tracing_context(parent=run_tree):\\n        async for chunk in parent_runnable.astream(inputs):\\n            yield chunk\\n\\nasync def main():\\n    return [val async for val in parent_function(\"call\")]\\n\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bContext propagation using threading\\nIt’s common to start tracing and want to apply some parallelism on child tasks all within a single trace. Python’s stdlib ThreadPoolExecutor by default breaks tracing.\\n\\u200bWhy\\nPython’s contextvars start empty within new threads. Here are two approaches to handle maintain trace contiguity:\\n\\u200bTo resolve\\n\\n\\nUsing LangSmith’s ContextThreadPoolExecutor\\nLangSmith provides a ContextThreadPoolExecutor that automatically handles context propagation:\\nCopyfrom langsmith.utils import ContextThreadPoolExecutor\\nfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef outer_func():\\n    with ContextThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\\n        inputs = [1, 2]\\n        r = list(executor.map(inner_func, inputs))\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef inner_func(x):\\n    print(x)\\n\\nouter_func()\\n\\n\\n\\nManually providing the parent run tree\\nAlternatively, you can manually pass the parent run tree to the inner function:\\nCopyfrom langsmith import traceable, get_current_run_tree\\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef outer_func():\\n    rt = get_current_run_tree()\\n    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\\n        r = list(\\n            executor.map(\\n                lambda x: inner_func(x, langsmith_extra={\"parent\": rt}), [1, 2]\\n            )\\n        )\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef inner_func(x):\\n    print(x)\\n\\nouter_func()\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this approach, we use get_current_run_tree() to obtain the current run tree and pass it to the inner function using the langsmith_extra parameter.\\nBoth methods ensure that the inner function calls are correctly aggregated under the initial trace stack, even when executed in separate threads.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsUpload files with tracesTroubleshoot variable caching⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This is useful to continuously monitor the performance of your application—to identify issues, measure improvements, and ensure consistent quality over time.\\nThere are two types of online evaluations supported in LangSmith:\\n\\nLLM-as-a-judge: Use an LLM to evaluate your traces. Used as a scalable way to provide human-like judgement to your output (e.g. toxicity, hallucination, correctness, etc.).\\nCustom Code: Write an evaluator in Python directly in LangSmith. Often used for validating structure or statistical properties of your data.\\n\\n\\u200bView online evaluators\\nHead to the Tracing Projects tab and select a tracing project. To view existing online evaluators for that project, click on the Evaluators tab.\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure online evaluators\\n\\u200b1. Navigate to online evaluators\\nHead to the Tracing Projects tab and select a tracing project. Click on + New in the top right corner of the tracing project page, then click on New Evaluator.\\n\\u200b2. Name your evaluator\\n\\u200b3. Create a filter\\nFor example, you may want to apply specific evaluators based on:\\n\\nRuns where a user left feedback indicating the response was unsatisfactory.\\nRuns that invoke a specific tool call. See filtering for tool calls for more information.\\nRuns that match a particular piece of metadata (e.g. if you log traces with a plan_type and only want to run evaluations on traces from your enterprise customers). See adding metadata to your traces for more information.\\n\\nFilters on evaluators work the same way as when you’re filtering traces in a project. For more information on filters, you can refer to this guide.\\nIt’s often helpful to inspect runs as you’re creating a filter for your evaluator. With the evaluator configuration panel open, you can inspect runs and apply filters to them. Any filters you apply to the runs table will automatically be reflected in filters on your evaluator.\\n\\u200b4. (Optional) Configure a sampling rate\\nConfigure a sampling rate to control the percentage of filtered runs that trigger the automation action. For example, to control costs, you may want to set a filter to only apply the evaluator to 10% of traces. In order to do this, you would set the sampling rate to 0.1.\\n\\u200b5. (Optional) Apply rule to past runs\\nApply rule to past runs by toggling the Apply to past runs and entering a “Backfill from” date. This is only possible upon rule creation. Note: the backfill is processed as a background job, so you will not see the results immediately.\\nIn order to track progress of the backfill, you can view logs for your evaluator by heading to the Evaluators tab within a tracing project and clicking the Logs button for the evaluator you created. Online evaluator logs are similar to automation rule logs.\\n\\nAdd an evaluator name\\nOptionally filter runs that you would like to apply your evaluator on or configure a sampling rate.\\nSelect Apply Evaluator\\n\\n\\u200b6.

We recommend testing locally before setting up your custom code evaluator in LangSmith.\\nIn the UI, you will see a panel that lets you write your code inline, with some starter code:\\n\\nCustom code evaluators take in one argument:\\n\\nA Run (reference). This represents the sampled run to evaluate.\\n\\nThey return a single value:\\n\\nFeedback(s) Dictionary: A dictionary whose keys are the type of feedback you want to return, and values are the score you will give for that feedback key. For example, {\"correctness\": 1, \"silliness\": 0} would create two types of feedback on the run, one saying it is correct, and the other saying it is not silly.\\n\\nIn the below screenshot, you can see an example of a simple function that validates that each run in the experiment has a known json field:\\nPythonJavaScriptCopyimport json\\n\\ndef perform_eval(run):\\n  output_to_validate = run[\\'outputs\\']\\n  is_valid_json = 0\\n\\n  # assert you can serialize/deserialize as json\\n  try:\\n    json.loads(json.dumps(output_to_validate))\\n  except Exception as e:\\n    return { \"formatted\": False }\\n\\n  # assert output facts exist\\n  if \"facts\" not in output_to_validate:\\n    return { \"formatted\": False }\\n\\n  # assert required fields exist\\n  if \"years_mentioned\" not in output_to_validate[\"facts\"]:\\n    return { \"formatted\": False }\\n\\n  return {\"formatted\": True}\\n\\n\\u200bTest and save your evaluation function\\nBefore saving, you can test your evaluator function on a recent run by clicking Test Code to make sure that your code executes properly.\\nOnce you Save, your online evaluator will run over newly sampled runs (or backfilled ones too if you chose the backfill option).\\nIf you prefer a video tutorial, check out the Online Evaluations video from the Introduction to LangSmith Course.\\n\\u200bVideo guide\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsLog user feedback using the SDKMonitor projects with dashboards⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Some examples of automations you can set up:\\n\\nSend all traces with negative feedback to an annotation queue for human review\\nSend 10% of all traces to an annotation queue for human review to spot check for issues\\nUpgrade all traces with errors for extended data retention\\n\\nTo configure online evaluations, visit the online evaluations page.\\n\\u200bView automation rules\\nHead to the Tracing Projects tab and select a tracing project.

Create a filter\\nAutomation rule filters work the same way as filters applied to traces in the project. For more information on filters, you can refer to this guide\\n\\u200b4. Configure a sampling rate\\nConfigure a sampling rate to control the percentage of filtered runs that trigger the automation action.\\nYou can specify a sampling rate between 0 and 1 for automations. This will control the percent of the filtered runs that are sent to an automation action. For example, if you set the sampling rate to 0.5, then 50% of the traces that pass the filter will be sent to the action.\\n\\u200b5. (Optional) Apply rule to past runs\\nApply rule to past runs by toggling the Apply to past runs and entering a “Backfill from” date. This is only possible upon rule creation. Note: the backfill is processed as a background job, so you will not see the results immediately. In order to track progress of the backfill, you can view logs for your automations\\n\\u200b6. Select an action to trigger when the rule is applied.\\nThere are four actions you can take with an automation rule:\\n\\nAdd to dataset: Add the inputs and outputs of the trace to a dataset.\\nAdd to annotation queue: Add the trace to an annotation queue.\\nTrigger webhook: Trigger a webhook with the trace data. For more information on webhooks, you can refer to this guide.\\nExtend data retention: Extends the data retention period on matching traces that use base retention (see data retention docs for more details).\\nNote that all other rules will also extend data retention on matching traces through the\\nauto-upgrade mechanism described in the aforementioned data retention docs,\\nbut this rule takes no additional action.\\n\\n\\u200bView logs for your automations\\nLogs allow you to gain confidence that your rules are working as expected. You can view logs for your automations by heading to the Automations tab within a tracing project and clicking the Logs button for the rule you created.\\nThe logs tab allows you to:\\n\\nView all runs processed by a given rule for the time period selected\\nIf a particular rule execution has triggered an error, you can view the error message by hovering over the error icon\\nYou can monitor the progress of a backfill job by filtering to the rule’s creation timestamp. This is because the backfill starts from when the rule was created.\\nInspect the run that the automation rule applied to using the View run button.

To down-sample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the LANGSMITH_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE environment variable to any float between 0 (no traces) and 1 (all traces).

If you are tracing using LangChain.js or LangGraph.js in serverless environments, see this guide.\\nWhen tracing JavaScript functions, LangSmith will trace runs in the background by default to avoid adding latency. In serverless environments where the execution context may be terminated abruptly, it’s important to ensure that all tracing data is properly flushed before the function completes.\\nTo make sure this occurs, you can either:\\n\\nSet an environment variable named LANGSMITH_TRACING_BACKGROUND to \"false\". This will cause your traced functions to wait for tracing to complete before returning.\\n\\nNote that this is named differently from the environment variable in LangChain.js because LangSmith can be used without LangChain.\\n\\n\\nPass a custom client into your traced runs and await the client.awaitPendingTraceBatches(); method.\\n\\nHere’s an example of using awaitPendingTraceBatches alongside the traceable method:\\nCopyimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nconst langsmithClient = new Client({});\\nconst tracedFn = traceable(\\n  async () => {\\n    return \"Some return value\";\\n  },\\n  {\\n    client: langsmithClient,\\n  }\\n);\\nconst res = await tracedFn();\\nawait langsmithClient.awaitPendingTraceBatches();\\n\\n\\u200bRate limits at high concurrency\\x0b\\nBy default, the LangSmith client will batch operations as your traced run executions, sending a new batch every few milliseconds.\\nThis works well in most situations, but if your traced function is long-running and you have very high concurrency, you may also hit rate limits related to overall request count.\\nIf you are seeing rate limit errors related to this, you can try setting manualFlushMode: true in your client like this:\\nCopyimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\nconst langsmithClient = new Client({  manualFlushMode: true,});\\nconst myTracedFunc = traceable(\\n  async () => {\\n    // Your logic here...\\n  },\\n  { client: langsmithClient }\\n);\\n\\nAnd then manually calling client.flush() like this before your serverless function closes:\\nCopytry {\\n  await myTracedFunc();\\n} finally {\\n  await langsmithClient.flush();\\n}\\n\\nNote that this will prevent runs from appearing in the LangSmith UI until you call .flush().Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsThreadsLog multimodal traces⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Below is an example.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\n@traceable\\ndef my_generator():\\n  for chunk in [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\"]:\\n      yield chunk\\n# Stream to the user\\nfor output in my_generator():\\n  print(output)\\n# It also works with async functions\\nimport asyncio\\n@traceable\\nasync def my_async_generator():\\n  for chunk in [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\"]:\\n      yield chunk\\n# Stream to the user\\nasync def main():\\n  async for output in my_async_generator():\\n      print(output)\\nasyncio.run(main())\\n\\n\\u200bAggregate Results\\x0b\\nBy default, the outputs of the traced function are aggregated into a single array in LangSmith. If you want to customize how it is stored (for instance, concatenating the outputs into a single string), you can use the aggregate option (reduce_fn in python). This is especially useful for aggregating streamed LLM outputs.\\nAggregating outputs only impacts the traced representation of the outputs. It doesn not alter the values returned by your function.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\ndef concatenate_strings(outputs: list):\\n  return \"\".join(outputs)\\n@traceable(reduce_fn=concatenate_strings)\\ndef my_generator():\\n  for chunk in [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\"]:\\n      yield chunk\\n# Stream to the user\\nfor output in my_generator():\\n  print(output)\\n# It also works with async functions\\nimport asyncio\\n@traceable(reduce_fn=concatenate_strings)\\nasync def my_async_generator():\\n  for chunk in [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"!\"]:\\n      yield chunk\\n# Stream to the user\\nasync def main():\\n  async for output in my_async_generator():\\n      print(output)\\nasyncio.run(main())\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsLog multimodal tracesAdd metadata and tags to traces⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

We have designed these SDKs with optimizations like batching and backgrounding to ensure that your application’s performance is not impacted by sending traces to LangSmith. However, if you are unable to use our SDKs, you can use the LangSmith REST API to send traces. Performance may be impacted if you send traces synchronously in your application. This guide will show you how to trace a request using the LangSmith REST API. Please view our API documentation  for a full list of endpoints and request/response schemas.\\n\\u200bBasic tracing\\nThe simplest way to log runs is via the POST and PATCH /runs endpoint. These routes expect minimal contextual information about the tree structure to\\nWhen using the LangSmith REST API, you will need to provide your API key in the request headers as \"x-api-key\".If your API key is linked to multiple workspaces, you will need to specify the workspace being used in the header with \"x-tenant-id\".In the simple example, you do not need to set the dotted_order opr trace_id fields in the request body. These fields will be automatically generated by the system. Though this is simpler, it is slower and has a lower rate limit in LangSmith.\\nThe following example shows how you might leverage our API directly in Python. The same principles apply to other languages.\\nCopyimport openai\\nimport os\\nimport requests\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\\nfrom uuid import uuid4\\n\\n# Send your API Key in the request headers\\nheaders = {\\n    \"x-api-key\": os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"],\\n    \"x-tenant-id\": os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID\"]\\n}\\n\\ndef post_run(run_id, name, run_type, inputs, parent_id=None):\\n    \"\"\"Function to post a new run to the API.\"\"\"\\n    data = {\\n        \"id\": run_id.hex,\\n        \"name\": name,\\n        \"run_type\": run_type,\\n        \"inputs\": inputs,\\n        \"start_time\": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),\\n        # \"session_name\": \"project-name\",  # the name of the project to trace to\\n        # \"session_id\": \"project-id\",  # the ID of the project to trace to. specify one of session_name or session_id\\n    }\\n    if parent_id:\\n        data[\"parent_run_id\"] = parent_id.hex\\n\\n    requests.post(\\n        \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs\",  # Update appropriately for self-hosted installations or the EU region\\n        json=data,\\n        headers=headers\\n    )\\n\\ndef patch_run(run_id, outputs):\\n    \"\"\"Function to patch a run with outputs.\"\"\"\\n    requests.patch(\\n        f\"https://api.smith.langchain.com/runs/{run_id}\",\\n        json={\\n            \"outputs\": outputs,\\n            \"end_time\": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),\\n        },\\n        headers=headers,\\n    )\\n\\n# This can be a user input to your app\\nquestion = \"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\"\\n\\n# This can be retrieved in a retrieval step\\ncontext = \"During this morning\\'s meeting, we solved all world conflict.\"\\n\\nmessages = [\\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.

This should be done before executing your application.\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_PROJECT=my-project\\n\\nThe LANGSMITH_PROJECT flag is only supported in JS SDK versions >= 0.2.16, use LANGCHAIN_PROJECT instead if you are using an older version.\\n\\u200bDynamically\\nThis largely builds off of the previous section and allows you to set the project name for a specific LangChainTracer instance or as parameters to the tracing_context context manager in Python.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# You can set the project name using the project_name parameter.\\nimport langsmith as ls\\n\\nwith ls.tracing_context(project_name=\"My Project\", enabled=True):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I using a context manager?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m using a context manager\"})\\n\\n\\u200bAdd metadata and tags to traces\\nYou can annotate your traces with arbitrary metadata and tags by providing them in the RunnableConfig. This is useful for associating additional information with a trace, such as the environment in which it was executed, or the user who initiated it. For information on how to query traces and runs by metadata and tags, see this guide\\nWhen you attach metadata or tags to a runnable (either through the RunnableConfig or at runtime with invocation params), they are inherited by all child runnables of that runnable.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful AI.\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"{input}\")\\n])\\n\\n# The tag \"model-tag\" and metadata {\"model-key\": \"model-value\"} will be attached to the ChatOpenAI run only\\nchat_model = ChatOpenAI().with_config({\"tags\": [\"model-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"model-key\": \"model-value\"}})\\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\\n\\n# Tags and metadata can be configured with RunnableConfig\\nchain = (prompt | chat_model | output_parser).with_config({\"tags\": [\"config-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"config-key\": \"config-value\"}})\\n\\n# Tags and metadata can also be passed at runtime\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"tags\": [\"invoke-tag\"], \"metadata\": {\"invoke-key\": \"invoke-value\"}})\\n\\n\\u200bCustomize run name\\nYou can customize the name of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the Config. This name is used to identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to filter and group runs. The name is also used as the title of the run in the LangSmith UI. This can be done by setting a run_name in the RunnableConfig object at construction or by passing a run_name in the invocation parameters in JS/TS.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopy# When tracing within LangChain, run names default to the class name of the traced object (e.g., \\'ChatOpenAI\\').\\nconfigured_chain = chain.with_config({\"run_name\": \"MyCustomChain\"})\\nconfigured_chain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"})\\n\\n# You can also configure the run name at invocation time, like below\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"run_name\": \"MyCustomChain\"})\\n\\nThe run_name parameter only changes the name of the runnable you invoke (e.g., a chain, function). It does not rename the nested run automatically created when you invoke an LLM object like ChatOpenAI (gpt-4o-mini). In the example, the enclosing run will appear in LangSmith as MyCustomChain, while the nested LLM run still shows the model’s default name.To give the LLM run a more meaningful name, you can either:\\nWrap the model in another runnable and assign a run_name to that step.\\nUse a tracing decorator or helper (e.g., @traceable in Python, or traceable from langsmith in JS/TS) to create a custom run around the model call.\\n\\n\\u200bCustomize run ID\\nYou can customize the ID of a given run when invoking or streaming your LangChain code by providing it in the Config. This ID is used to uniquely identify the run in LangSmith and can be used to query specific runs. The ID can be useful for linking runs across different systems or for implementing custom tracking logic. This can be done by setting a run_id in the RunnableConfig object at construction or by passing a run_id in the invocation parameters.\\nThis feature is not currently supported directly for LLM objects.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport uuid\\n\\nmy_uuid = uuid.uuid4()\\n\\n# You can configure the run ID at invocation time:\\nchain.invoke({\"input\": \"What is the meaning of life?\"}, {\"run_id\": my_uuid})\\n\\nNote that if you do this at the root of a trace (i.e., the top-level run, that run ID will be used as the trace_id).\\n\\u200bAccess run (span) ID for LangChain invocations\\nWhen you invoke a LangChain object, you can manually specify the run ID of the invocation. This run ID can be used to query the run in LangSmith.\\nIn JS/TS, you can use a RunCollectorCallbackHandler instance to access the run ID.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport uuid\\n\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user\\'s request only based on the given context.\"),\\n    (\"user\", \"Question: {question}\\\\n\\\\nContext: {context}\")\\n])\\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\\noutput_parser = StrOutputParser()\\n\\nchain = prompt | model | output_parser\\n\\nquestion = \"Can you summarize this morning\\'s meetings?\"\\ncontext = \"During this morning\\'s meeting, we solved all world conflict.\"\\nmy_uuid = uuid.uuid4()\\nresult = chain.invoke({\"question\": question, \"context\": context}, {\"run_id\": my_uuid})\\nprint(my_uuid)\\n\\n\\u200bEnsure all traces are submitted before exiting\\nIn LangChain Python, LangSmith’s tracing is done in a background thread to avoid obstructing your production application. This means that your process may end before all traces are successfully posted to LangSmith. This is especially prevalent in a serverless environment, where your VM may be terminated immediately once your chain or agent completes.\\nYou can make callbacks synchronous by setting the LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND environment variable to \"false\".\\nFor both languages, LangChain exposes methods to wait for traces to be submitted before exiting your application. Below is an example:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.tracers.langchain import wait_for_all_tracers\\n\\nllm = ChatOpenAI()\\n\\ntry:\\n  llm.invoke(\"Hello, World!\")\\nfinally:\\n  wait_for_all_tracers()\\n\\n\\u200bTrace without setting environment variables\\nAs mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:\\n\\nLANGSMITH_TRACING\\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY\\nLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT\\nLANGSMITH_PROJECT\\n\\nHowever, in some environments, it is not possible to set environment variables. In these cases, you can set the tracing configuration programmatically.\\nThis largely builds off of the previous section.\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyimport langsmith as ls\\n\\n# You can create a client instance with an api key and api url\\nclient = ls.Client(\\n    api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\",  # This can be retrieved from a secrets manager\\n    api_url=\"https://api.smith.langchain.com\",  # Update appropriately for self-hosted installations or the EU region\\n)\\n\\n# You can pass the client and project_name to the tracing_context\\nwith ls.tracing_context(client=client, project_name=\"test-no-env\", enabled=True):\\n    chain.invoke({\"question\": \"Am I using a callback?\", \"context\": \"I\\'m using a callback\"})\\n\\n\\u200bDistributed tracing with LangChain (Python)\\nLangSmith supports distributed tracing with LangChain Python. This allows you to link runs (spans) across different services and applications. The principles are similar to the distributed tracing guide for the LangSmith SDK.\\nCopyimport langsmith\\nfrom langchain_core.runnables import chain\\nfrom langsmith.run_helpers import get_current_run_tree\\n\\n# -- This code should be in a separate file or service --\\n@chain\\ndef child_chain(inputs):\\n    return inputs[\"test\"] + 1\\n\\ndef child_wrapper(x, headers):\\n    with langsmith.tracing_context(parent=headers):\\n        child_chain.invoke({\"test\": x})\\n\\n# -- This code should be in a separate file or service --\\n@chain\\ndef parent_chain(inputs):\\n    rt = get_current_run_tree()\\n    headers = rt.to_headers()\\n    # ... make a request to another service with the headers\\n    # The headers should be passed to the other service, eventually to the child_wrapper function\\n\\nparent_chain.invoke({\"test\": 1})\\n\\n\\u200bInteroperability between LangChain (Python) and LangSmith SDK\\nIf you are using LangChain for part of your application and the LangSmith SDK (see this guide) for other parts, you can still trace the entire application seamlessly.\\nLangChain objects will be traced when invoked within a traceable function and be bound as a child run of the traceable function.\\nCopyfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\\nfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n    (\"system\", \"You are a helpful assistant.

The following limitations are present when using combining LangChain with traceable:\\nMutating RunTree obtained from getCurrentRunTree() of the RunnableLambda context will result in a no-op.\\nIt’s discouraged to traverse the RunTree obtained from RunnableLambda via getCurrentRunTree() as it may not contain all the RunTree nodes.\\nDifferent child runs may have the same execution_order and child_execution_order value. Thus in extreme circumstances, some runs may end up in a different order, depending on the start_time.\\n\\nIn some uses cases, you might want to run traceable functions as part of the RunnableSequence or trace child runs of LangChain run imperatively via the RunTree API. Starting with LangSmith 0.1.39 and @langchain/core 0.2.18, you can directly invoke traceable-wrapped functions within RunnableLambda.\\nCopyimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { RunnableLambda } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\nimport { RunnableConfig } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\n\\nconst tracedChild = traceable((input: string) => `Child Run: ${input}`, {\\n  name: \"Child Run\",\\n});\\n\\nconst parrot = new RunnableLambda({\\n  func: async (input: { text: string }, config?: RunnableConfig) => {\\n    return await tracedChild(input.text);\\n  },\\n});\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, you can convert LangChain’s RunnableConfig to a equivalent RunTree object by using RunTree.fromRunnableConfig or pass the RunnableConfig as the first argument of traceable-wrapped function.\\nTraceableRun TreeCopyimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { RunnableLambda } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\nimport { RunnableConfig } from \"@langchain/core/runnables\";\\n\\nconst tracedChild = traceable((input: string) => `Child Run: ${input}`, {\\n  name: \"Child Run\",\\n});\\n\\nconst parrot = new RunnableLambda({\\n  func: async (input: { text: string }, config?: RunnableConfig) => {\\n    // Pass the config to existing traceable function\\n    await tracedChild(config, input.text);\\n    return input.text;\\n  },\\n});\\n\\nIf you prefer a video tutorial, check out the Alternative Ways to Trace video from the Introduction to LangSmith Course.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewLangGraph⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This guide covers both automatic instrumentation for LangChain applications and manual instrumentation for other frameworks.\\nFor self-hosted and EU region deploymentsUpdate the LangSmith URL appropriately for self-hosted installations or organizations in the EU region in the requests below. For the EU region, use eu.api.smith.langchain.com.\\nTrace a LangChain application\\u200b\\nIf you\\'re using LangChain or LangGraph, use the built-in integration to trace your application:\\n\\n\\nInstall the LangSmith package with OpenTelemetry support:\\npip install \"langsmith[otel]\"pip install langchain\\ninfoRequires Python SDK version langsmith>=0.3.18.\\n\\n\\nIn your LangChain/LangGraph App, enable the OpenTelemetry integration by setting the LANGSMITH_OTEL_ENABLED environment variable:\\nLANGSMITH_OTEL_ENABLED=trueLANGSMITH_TRACING=trueLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.comLANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key>\\n\\n\\nCreate a LangChain application with tracing. For example:\\nimport osfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate# Create a chainprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"Tell me a joke about {topic}\")model = ChatOpenAI()chain = prompt | model# Run the chainresult = chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"programming\"})print(result.content)\\n\\n\\nView the traces in your LangSmith dashboard (example) once your application runs.\\n\\n\\nTrace a non-LangChain application\\u200b\\nFor non-LangChain applications or custom instrumentation, you can trace your application in LangSmith with a standard OpenTelemetry client:\\n\\n\\nInstall the OpenTelemetry SDK, OpenTelemetry exporter packages, as well as the OpenAI package:\\npip install openaipip install opentelemetry-sdkpip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp\\n\\n\\nSetup environment variables for the endpoint, substitute your specific values:\\nOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com/otelOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=\"x-api-key=<your langsmith api key>\"\\nTrace endpointDepending on how your otel exporter is configured, you may need to append /v1/traces to the endpoint if you are only sending traces.\\nSelf-hosted deploymentsIf you\\'re self-hosting LangSmith, replace the base endpoint with your LangSmith api endpoint and append /api/v1. For example: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://ai-company.com/api/v1/otel\\nOptional: Specify a custom project name other than \"default\":\\nOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com/otelOTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=\"x-api-key=<your langsmith api key>,Langsmith-Project=<project name>\"\\n\\n\\nLog a trace.\\nThis code sets up an OTEL tracer and exporter that will send traces to LangSmith.

This is useful if you\\nwant to group runs together in LangSmith:\\nCopyimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\nimport { tool, stepCountIs } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\\n\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { wrapAISDK } from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\n\\nconst { generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject } =\\n  wrapAISDK(ai);\\n\\nconst wrapper = traceable(async (input: string) => {\\n  const { text } = await generateText({\\n    model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n    messages: [\\n      {\\n        role: \"user\",\\n        content: input,\\n      },\\n    ],\\n    tools: {\\n      listOrders: tool({\\n        description: \"list all orders\",\\n        inputSchema: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),\\n        execute: async ({ userId }) =>\\n          `User ${userId} has the following orders: 1`,\\n      }),\\n      viewTrackingInformation: tool({\\n        description: \"view tracking information for a specific order\",\\n        inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),\\n        execute: async ({ orderId }) =>\\n          `Here is the tracking information for ${orderId}`,\\n      }),\\n    },\\n    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),\\n  });\\n  return text;\\n}, {\\n  name: \"wrapper\",\\n});\\n\\nawait wrapper(\"What are my orders and where are they? My user ID is 123.\");\\n\\nThe resulting trace will look like this.\\n\\u200bTracing in serverless environments\\nWhen tracing in serverless environments, you must wait for all runs to flush before your environment\\nshuts down. To do this, you can pass a LangSmith Client instance when wrapping the AI SDK method,\\nthen call await client.awaitPendingTraceBatches().\\nMake sure to also pass it into any traceable wrappers you create as well:\\nCopyimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\nimport { tool, stepCountIs } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\\n\\nimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { wrapAISDK } from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\n\\nconst client = new Client();\\n\\nconst { generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject } =\\n  wrapAISDK(ai, { client });\\n\\nconst wrapper = traceable(async (input: string) => {\\n  const { text } = await generateText({\\n    model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n    messages: [\\n      {\\n        role: \"user\",\\n        content: input,\\n      },\\n    ],\\n    tools: {\\n      listOrders: tool({\\n        description: \"list all orders\",\\n        inputSchema: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),\\n        execute: async ({ userId }) =>\\n          `User ${userId} has the following orders: 1`,\\n      }),\\n      viewTrackingInformation: tool({\\n        description: \"view tracking information for a specific order\",\\n        inputSchema: z.object({ orderId: z.string() }),\\n        execute: async ({ orderId }) =>\\n          `Here is the tracking information for ${orderId}`,\\n      }),\\n    },\\n    stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),\\n  });\\n  return text;\\n}, {\\n  name: \"wrapper\",\\n  client,\\n});\\n\\ntry {\\n  await wrapper(\"What are my orders and where are they? My user ID is 123.\");\\n} finally {\\n  await client.awaitPendingTraceBatches();\\n}\\n\\nIf you are using Next.js, there is a convenient after hook\\nwhere you can put this logic:\\nCopyimport { after } from \"next/server\"\\nimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\n\\n\\nexport async function POST(request: Request) {\\n  const client = new Client();\\n\\n  ...\\n\\n  after(async () => {\\n    await client.awaitPendingTraceBatches();\\n  });\\n\\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ ... }), {\\n    status: 200,\\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\\n  });\\n};\\n\\nSee this page for more detail, including information\\naround managing rate limits in serverless environments.\\n\\u200bPassing LangSmith config\\nYou can pass LangSmith-specific config to your wrapper both when initially wrapping your\\nAI SDK methods and while running them via providerOptions.langsmith.\\nThis includes metadata (which you can later use to filter runs in LangSmith), top-level run name,\\ntags, custom client instances, and more.\\nConfig passed while wrapping will apply to all future calls you make with the wrapped method:\\nCopyimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\n\\nimport { wrapAISDK } from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\n\\nconst { generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject } =\\n  wrapAISDK(ai, {\\n    metadata: {\\n      key_for_all_runs: \"value\",\\n    },\\n    tags: [\"myrun\"],\\n  });\\n\\nawait generateText({\\n  model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n  prompt: \"Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.\",\\n});\\n\\nWhile passing config at runtime via providerOptions.langsmith will apply only to that run.\\nWe suggest importing and wrapping your config in createLangSmithProviderOptions to ensure\\nproper typing:\\nCopyimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\n\\nimport {\\n  wrapAISDK,\\n  createLangSmithProviderOptions,\\n} from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\n\\nconst { generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject } =\\n  wrapAISDK(ai);\\n\\nconst lsConfig = createLangSmithProviderOptions({\\n  metadata: {\\n    individual_key: \"value\",\\n  },\\n  name: \"my_individual_run\",\\n});\\n\\nawait generateText({\\n  model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n  prompt: \"Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.\",\\n  providerOptions: {\\n    langsmith: lsConfig,\\n  },\\n});\\n\\n\\u200bRedacting data\\nYou can customize what inputs and outputs the AI SDK sends to LangSmith by specifying custom input/output\\nprocessing functions. This is useful if you are dealing with sensitive data that you would like to\\navoid sending to LangSmith.\\nBecause output formats vary depending on which AI SDK method you are using, we suggest defining and passing config\\nindividually into wrapped methods. You will also need to provide separate functions for child LLM runs within\\nAI SDK calls, since calling generateText at top level calls the LLM internally and can do so multiple times.\\nWe also suggest passing a generic parameter into createLangSmithProviderOptions to get proper types for inputs and outputs.\\nHere’s an example for generateText:\\nCopyimport {\\n  wrapAISDK,\\n  createLangSmithProviderOptions,\\n} from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\nimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\n\\nconst { generateText } = wrapAISDK(ai);\\n\\nconst lsConfig = createLangSmithProviderOptions<typeof generateText>({\\n  processInputs: (inputs) => {\\n    const { messages } = inputs;\\n    return {\\n      messages: messages?.map((message) => ({\\n        providerMetadata: message.providerOptions,\\n        role: \"assistant\",\\n        content: \"REDACTED\",\\n      })),\\n      prompt: \"REDACTED\",\\n    };\\n  },\\n  processOutputs: (outputs) => {\\n    return {\\n      providerMetadata: outputs.providerMetadata,\\n      role: \"assistant\",\\n      content: \"REDACTED\",\\n    };\\n  },\\n  processChildLLMRunInputs: (inputs) => {\\n    const { prompt } = inputs;\\n    return {\\n      messages: prompt.map((message) => ({\\n        ...message,\\n        content: \"REDACTED CHILD INPUTS\",\\n      })),\\n    };\\n  },\\n  processChildLLMRunOutputs: (outputs) => {\\n    return {\\n      providerMetadata: outputs.providerMetadata,\\n      content: \"REDACTED CHILD OUTPUTS\",\\n      role: \"assistant\",\\n    };\\n  },\\n});\\n\\nconst { text } = await generateText({\\n  model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n  prompt: \"What is the capital of France?\",\\n  providerOptions: {\\n    langsmith: lsConfig,\\n  },\\n});\\n\\n// Paris.\\nconsole.log(text);\\n\\nThe actual return value will contain the original, non-redacted result but the trace in LangSmith\\nwill be redacted. Here’s an example.\\nFor redacting tool input/output, wrap your execute method in a traceable like this:\\nCopyimport * as ai from \"ai\";\\nimport { tool, stepCountIs } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\\n\\nimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { wrapAISDK } from \"langsmith/experimental/vercel\";\\n\\nconst client = new Client();\\n\\nconst { generateText, streamText, generateObject, streamObject } =\\n  wrapAISDK(ai, { client });\\n\\nconst { text } = await generateText({\\n  model: openai(\"gpt-5-nano\"),\\n  messages: [\\n    {\\n      role: \"user\",\\n      content: \"What are my orders? My user ID is 123.\",\\n    },\\n  ],\\n  tools: {\\n    listOrders: tool({\\n      description: \"list all orders\",\\n      inputSchema: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),\\n      execute: traceable(\\n        async ({ userId }) => {\\n          return `User ${userId} has the following orders: 1`;\\n        },\\n        {\\n          processInputs: (input) => ({ text: \"REDACTED\" }),\\n          processOutputs: (outputs) => ({ text: \"REDACTED\" }),\\n          run_type: \"tool\",\\n          name: \"listOrders\",\\n        }\\n      ) as (input: { userId: string }) => Promise<string>,\\n    }),\\n  },\\n  stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),\\n});\\n\\nThe traceable return type is complex, which makes the cast\\xa0necessary. You may also omit the AI SDK tool wrapper function\\nif you wish to avoid the cast.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSemantic KernelCustom instrumentation⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you are on AI SDK 5,\\nwe strongly suggest using our recommended approach for tracing AI SDK runs.\\n\\u200b0. Installation\\nInstall the Vercel AI SDK and required OTEL packages.

Log a trace\\n\\u200bNode.js\\nTo start tracing, you will need to import and call the initializeOTEL method at the start of your code:\\nCopyimport { initializeOTEL } from \"langsmith/experimental/otel/setup\";\\n\\nconst { DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR } = initializeOTEL();\\n\\nAfterwards, add the experimental_telemetry argument to your AI SDK calls that you want to trace.\\nDo not forget to call await DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR.shutdown(); before your application shuts down in order to flush any remaining traces to LangSmith.\\nCopyimport { generateText } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\n\\nlet result;\\ntry {\\n  result = await generateText({\\n    model: openai(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"),\\n    prompt: \"Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.\",\\n    experimental_telemetry: {\\n      isEnabled: true,\\n    },\\n  });\\n} finally {\\n  await DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR.shutdown();\\n}\\n\\nYou should see a trace in your LangSmith dashboard like this one.\\nYou can also trace runs with tool calls:\\nCopyimport { generateText, tool } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\\n\\nawait generateText({\\n  model: openai(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"),\\n  messages: [\\n    {\\n      role: \"user\",\\n      content: \"What are my orders and where are they?

If you do so, we recommend you initialize a LangSmith client instance that you pass into each traceable, then call client.awaitPendingTraceBatches(); to ensure all traces flush. If you do this, you do not need to manually call shutdown() or forceFlush() on the DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR. Here’s an example:\\nCopyimport { initializeOTEL } from \"langsmith/experimental/otel/setup\";\\n\\ninitializeOTEL();\\n\\nimport { Client } from \"langsmith\";\\nimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\nimport { generateText, tool } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\\n\\nconst client = new Client();\\n\\nconst wrappedText = traceable(\\n  async (content: string) => {\\n    const { text } = await generateText({\\n      model: openai(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"),\\n      messages: [{ role: \"user\", content }],\\n      tools: {\\n        listOrders: tool({\\n          description: \"list all orders\",\\n          parameters: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),\\n          execute: async ({ userId }) => {\\n            const getOrderNumber = traceable(\\n              async () => {\\n                return \"1234\";\\n              },\\n              { name: \"getOrderNumber\" }\\n            );\\n            const orderNumber = await getOrderNumber();\\n            return `User ${userId} has the following order: ${orderNumber}`;\\n          },\\n        }),\\n      },\\n      experimental_telemetry: {\\n        isEnabled: true,\\n      },\\n      maxSteps: 10,\\n    });\\n    return { text };\\n  },\\n  { name: \"parentTraceable\", client }\\n);\\n\\nlet result;\\ntry {\\n  result = await wrappedText(\"What are my orders?\");\\n} finally {\\n  await client.awaitPendingTraceBatches();\\n}\\n\\nThe resulting trace will look like this.\\n\\u200bNext.js\\nFirst, install the @vercel/otel package:\\nnpmyarnpnpmCopynpm install @vercel/otel\\n\\nThen, set up an instrumentation.ts file in your root directory.\\nCall initializeOTEL and pass the resulting DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR into the spanProcessors field into your registerOTEL(...) call.\\nIt should look something like this:\\nCopyimport { registerOTel } from \"@vercel/otel\";\\nimport { initializeOTEL } from \"langsmith/experimental/otel/setup\";\\n\\nconst { DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR } = initializeOTEL({});\\n\\nexport function register() {\\n  registerOTel({\\n    serviceName: \"your-project-name\",\\n    spanProcessors: [DEFAULT_LANGSMITH_SPAN_PROCESSOR],\\n  });\\n}\\n\\nAnd finally, in your API routes, call initializeOTEL as well and add an experimental_telemetry field to your AI SDK calls:\\nCopyimport { generateText } from \"ai\";\\nimport { openai } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\\n\\nimport { initializeOTEL } from \"langsmith/experimental/otel/setup\";\\n\\ninitializeOTEL();\\n\\nexport async function GET() {\\n  const { text } = await generateText({\\n    model: openai(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"),\\n    messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"Why is the sky blue?\" }],\\n    experimental_telemetry: {\\n      isEnabled: true,\\n    },\\n  });\\n\\n  return new Response(text);\\n}\\n\\nYou can also wrap parts of your code in traceables for more granularity.\\n\\u200bSentry\\nIf you’re using Sentry, you can attach the LangSmith trace exporter to Sentry’s default OpenTelemetry instrumentation as show in the example below.\\nAt time of writing, Sentry only supports OTEL v1 packages.

This is particularly useful when working with LLM pipelines using multimodal inputs or outputs.\\nIn both the Python and TypeScript SDKs, attachments can be added to your traces by specifying the MIME type and binary content of each file. This guide explains how to define and trace attachments using the Attachment type in Python and Uint8Array / ArrayBuffer in TypeScript.\\n\\u200bPython\\nIn the Python SDK, you can use the Attachment type to add files to your traces. Each Attachment requires:\\n\\nmime_type (str): The MIME type of the file (e.g., \"image/png\").\\ndata (bytes | Path): The binary content of the file, or the file path.\\n\\nYou can also define an attachment with a tuple tuple of the form (mime_type, data) for convenience.\\nSimply decorate a function with @traceable and include your Attachment instances as arguments. Note that to use the file path instead of the raw bytes, you need to set the dangerously_allow_filesystem flag to True in your traceable decorator.\\nPythonCopyfrom langsmith import traceable\\nfrom langsmith.schemas import Attachment\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nimport os\\n\\n# Must set dangerously_allow_filesystem to True if you want to use file paths\\n@traceable(dangerously_allow_filesystem=True)\\ndef trace_with_attachments(\\n    val: int,\\n    text: str,\\n    image: Attachment,\\n    audio: Attachment,\\n    video: Attachment,\\n    pdf: Attachment,\\n    csv: Attachment,\\n):\\n    return f\"Processed: {val}, {text}, {len(image.data)}, {len(audio.data)}, {len(video.data)}, {len(pdf.data), {len(csv.data)}}\"\\n\\n# Helper function to load files as bytes\\ndef load_file(file_path: str) -> bytes:\\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f:\\n        return f.read()\\n\\n# Load files and create attachments\\nimage_data = load_file(\"my_image.png\")\\naudio_data = load_file(\"my_mp3.mp3\")\\nvideo_data = load_file(\"my_video.mp4\")\\npdf_data = load_file(\"my_document.pdf\")\\n\\nimage_attachment = Attachment(mime_type=\"image/png\", data=image_data)\\naudio_attachment = Attachment(mime_type=\"audio/mpeg\", data=audio_data)\\nvideo_attachment = Attachment(mime_type=\"video/mp4\", data=video_data)\\npdf_attachment = (\"application/pdf\", pdf_data) # Can just define as tuple of (mime_type, data)\\ncsv_attachment = Attachment(mime_type=\"text/csv\", data=Path(os.getcwd()) / \"my_csv.csv\")\\n\\n# Define other parameters\\nval = 42\\ntext = \"Hello, world!\"\\n\\n# Call the function with traced attachments\\nresult = trace_with_attachments(\\n    val=val,\\n    text=text,\\n    image=image_attachment,\\n    audio=audio_attachment,\\n    video=video_attachment,\\n    pdf=pdf_attachment,\\n    csv=csv_attachment,\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bTypeScript\\nIn the TypeScript SDK, you can add attachments to traces by using Uint8Array or ArrayBuffer as data types. Each attachment’s MIME type is specified within extractAttachments:\\n\\nUint8Array: Useful for handling binary data directly.\\nArrayBuffer: Represents fixed-length binary data, which can be converted to Uint8Array as needed.\\n\\nWrap your function with traceable and include your attachments within the extractAttachments option.\\nIn the TypeScript SDK, the extractAttachments function is an optional parameter in the traceable configuration. When the traceable-wrapped function is invoked, it extracts binary data (e.g., images, audio files) from your inputs and logs them alongside other trace data, specifying their MIME types.\\nNote that you cannot directly pass in a file path in the TypeScript SDK, as accessing local files is not supported in all runtime environments.\\nTypeScriptCopytype AttachmentData = Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer;\\ntype Attachments = Record<string, [string, AttachmentData]>;\\n\\nextractAttachments?: (\\n    ...args: Parameters<Func>\\n) => [Attachments | undefined, KVMap];\\n\\nTypeScriptCopyimport { traceable } from \"langsmith/traceable\";\\n\\nconst traceableWithAttachments = traceable(\\n    (\\n        val: number,\\n        text: string,\\n        attachment: Uint8Array,\\n        attachment2: ArrayBuffer,\\n        attachment3: Uint8Array,\\n        attachment4: ArrayBuffer,\\n        attachment5: Uint8Array,\\n    ) =>\\n        `Processed: ${val}, ${text}, ${attachment.length}, ${attachment2.byteLength}, ${attachment3.length}, ${attachment4.byteLength}, ${attachment5.byteLength}`,\\n    {\\n        name: \"traceWithAttachments\",\\n        extractAttachments: (\\n            val: number,\\n            text: string,\\n            attachment: Uint8Array,\\n            attachment2: ArrayBuffer,\\n            attachment3: Uint8Array,\\n            attachment4: ArrayBuffer,\\n            attachment5: Uint8Array,\\n        ) => [\\n            {\\n                \"image inputs\": [\"image/png\", attachment],\\n                \"mp3 inputs\": [\"audio/mpeg\", new Uint8Array(attachment2)],\\n                \"video inputs\": [\"video/mp4\", attachment3],\\n                \"pdf inputs\": [\"application/pdf\", new Uint8Array(attachment4)],\\n                \"csv inputs\": [\"text/csv\", new Uint8Array(attachment5)],\\n            },\\n            { val, text },\\n        ],\\n    }\\n);\\n\\nconst fs = Deno // or Node.js fs module\\nconst image = await fs.readFile(\"my_image.png\"); // Uint8Array\\nconst mp3Buffer = await fs.readFile(\"my_mp3.mp3\");\\nconst mp3ArrayBuffer = mp3Buffer.buffer; // Convert to ArrayBuffer\\nconst video = await fs.readFile(\"my_video.mp4\"); // Uint8Array\\nconst pdfBuffer = await fs.readFile(\"my_document.pdf\");\\nconst pdfArrayBuffer = pdfBuffer.buffer; // Convert to ArrayBuffer\\nconst csv = await fs.readFile(\"test-vals.csv\"); // Uint8Array\\n\\n// Define example parameters\\nconst val = 42;\\nconst text = \"Hello, world!\";\\n\\n// Call traceableWithAttachments with the files\\nconst result = await traceableWithAttachments(\\n    val, text, image, mp3ArrayBuffer, video, pdfArrayBuffer, csv\\n);\\n\\nHere is how the above would look in the LangSmith UI.

Then, locally install the Modal SDK:\\npipuvCopypip install modal\\n\\nTo finish setting up your account, run the command:\\nCopymodal setup\\n\\nand follow the instructions\\n\\u200bSecrets\\nNext, you will need to set up some secrets in Modal.\\nFirst, LangSmith will need to authenticate to Modal by passing in a secret.\\nThe easiest way to do this is to pass in a secret in the query parameters.\\nTo validate this secret, we will need to add a secret in Modal to validate it.\\nWe will do that by creating a Modal secret.\\nYou can see instructions for secrets here.\\nFor this purpose, let’s call our secret ls-webhook and have it set an environment variable with the name LS_WEBHOOK.\\nWe can also set up a LangSmith secret - luckily there is already an integration template for this!\\n\\n\\u200bService\\nAfter that, you can create a Python file that will serve as your endpoint.\\nAn example is below, with comments explaining what is going on:\\nCopyfrom fastapi import HTTPException, status, Request, Query\\nfrom modal import Secret, Stub, web_endpoint, Image\\n\\nstub = Stub(\"auth-example\", image=Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"langsmith\"))\\n\\n\\n@stub.function(\\n    secrets=[Secret.from_name(\"ls-webhook\"), Secret.from_name(\"my-langsmith-secret\")]\\n)\\n# We want this to be a `POST` endpoint since we will post data here\\n@web_endpoint(method=\"POST\")\\n# We set up a `secret` query parameter\\ndef f(data: dict, secret: str = Query(...)):\\n    # You can import dependencies you don\\'t have locally inside Modal functions\\n    from langsmith import Client\\n\\n    # First, we validate the secret key we pass\\n    import os\\n\\n    if secret != os.environ[\"LS_WEBHOOK\"]:\\n        raise HTTPException(\\n            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,\\n            detail=\"Incorrect bearer token\",\\n            headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\\n        )\\n\\n    # This is where we put the logic for what should happen inside this webhook\\n    ls_client = Client()\\n    runs = data[\"runs\"]\\n    ids = [r[\"id\"] for r in runs]\\n    feedback = list(ls_client.list_feedback(run_ids=ids))\\n    for r, f in zip(runs, feedback):\\n        try:\\n            ls_client.create_example(\\n                inputs=r[\"inputs\"],\\n                outputs={\"output\": f.correction},\\n                dataset_name=\"classifier-github-issues\",\\n            )\\n        except Exception:\\n            raise ValueError(f\"{r} and {f}\")\\n    # Function body\\n    return \"success!\"\\n\\nWe can now deploy this easily with modal deploy ... (see docs here).\\nYou should now get something like:\\nCopy✓ Created objects.\\n├── 🔨 Created mount /Users/harrisonchase/workplace/langsmith-docs/example-webhook.py\\n├── 🔨 Created mount PythonPackage:langsmith\\n└── 🔨 Created f => https://hwchase17--auth-example-f.modal.run\\n✓ App deployed! 🎉\\n\\nView Deployment: https://modal.com/apps/hwchase17/auth-example\\n\\nThe important thing to remember is https://hwchase17--auth-example-f.modal.run - the function we created to run.\\nNOTE: this is NOT the final deployment URL, make sure not to accidentally use that.\\n\\u200bHooking it up\\nWe can now take the function URL we create above and add it as a webhook.\\nWe have to remember to also pass in the secret key as a query parameter.\\nPutting it all together, it should look something like:\\nCopyhttps://hwchase17--auth-example-f-dev.modal.run?secret={SECRET}\\n\\nReplace {SECRET} with the secret key you created to access the Modal service.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSet up automation rulesLog user feedback using the SDK⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

Contact our sales team to learn more.Do you offer a plan for startups?\\n\\nYes! We offer a Startup Plan for LangSmith, designed for early-stage companies building agentic applications. You’ll get discounted rates and generous free trace allotments to build with confidence from day one.\\u200d\\u200dApply here to get started with startup pricing. Customers can stay on the Startup Plan for 2 years before graduating to the Plus Plan.When will I be billed?\\n\\nFor the Developer or Plus Plan, seats are billed monthly on the 1st or pro-rated if added mid-month (no credit for removed seats); traces are billed monthly in arrears for your usage. Enterprise plans are invoiced annually upfront.Will you train on the data that I send to LangSmith or LangGraph Platform?\\n\\nWe will not train on your data, and you own all rights to your data. See our Terms of Service for more information.LangSmith QuestionsWhat is a trace? Can it contain multiple events?\\n\\nA trace represents a single execution of your application—whether it’s an agent, evaluator, or playground session. It can include many individual steps, such as LLM calls and other tracked events. Here\\'s an example of a single trace.What is the difference between a base trace and an extended trace?\\n\\nBase traces have a shorter retention period of 14 days and cost $0.50 per 1k traces. Extended traces have a longer retention period of 400 days and cost $5.00 per 1k traces. You can \"upgrade\" base traces to extended traces at $4.50 per 1k traces.Why might I want to upgrade a base trace to an extended trace?\\n\\nBase traces are short-lived (14-day retention) and ideal for quick debugging or ad-hoc analysis. They’re priced for volume and short-term utility.\\u200dExtended traces, on the other hand, are retained for 400 days and often include valuable feedback—whether from users, evaluators, or human labelers. This feedback makes them essential for ongoing improvement and model tuning (higher utility), which comes with a higher price point.\\u200dLangSmith lets you choose the right retention for each trace, helping you balance cost and value.

I’ve exhausted my free trace allocation. What can I do?\\n\\nIf you’ve used up your free traces, you can input your credit card details on the Developer or Plus plans to continue sending traces to LangSmith. If you’ve hit the performance usage limits on your tier, you can upgrade to a higher plan to get better limits, or reach out to support@langchain.dev with questions.LangGraph Platform QuestionsDoes LangGraph Platform include any free deployments?\\n\\nPlus plans include 1 free dev-sized deployment. If you spin up additional dev-sized or production-sized deployments, you’ll be charged by usage (nodes executed and uptime).For my free Dev deployment for LangGraph Platform, is there a cap on the number of nodes executed?\\n\\nIf you’re on the Plus plan, you get 1 free dev-sized deployment – all usage in this deployment will be free no matter how many node executions are run.How do you define nodes executed?\\n\\nNodes Executed is the aggregate number of nodes in a LangGraph application that are called and completed successfully during an invocation of the application. If a node in the graph is not called during execution or ends in an error state, these nodes will not be counted. If a node is called and completes successfully multiple times, each occurrence will be counted.What does uptime mean for LangGraph Platform usage?\\n\\nUptime is the duration your deployment’s database is live and persisting state. Uptime will be tracked as soon as your deployment is live and ends when you shut it down. Dev deployments are typically short-lived (used during iteration, then deleted) – whereas Production deployments stay live and are updated via revisions (rather than being deleted).\\xa0When should I use a dev-sized deployment vs. a production-sized deployment?\\n\\nWe recommend using the production-sized deployment for any customer-facing agent. Dev-sized deployments are intended for testing and do not support horizontal scaling, backups, or performance optimizations needed in production.Ready to start shipping \\u2028reliable agents faster?Get started with tools from the LangChain product suite for every step of the agent development lifecycle.Get a demoSign up for freeProductsLangChainLangSmithLangGraphResourcesGuidesBlogCustomer StoriesLangChain AcademyCommunityEventsChangelogDocsCompanyAboutCareersXLinkedInYouTubeMarketing AssetsSecuritySign up for our newsletter to stay up to dateThank you!

If you spin up additional dev-sized or production-sized deployments, you’ll be charged by usage (nodes executed and uptime).For my free Dev deployment for LangGraph Platform, is there a cap on the number of nodes executed?\\n\\nIf you’re on the Plus plan, you get 1 free dev-sized deployment – all usage in this deployment will be free no matter how many node executions are run.How do you define nodes executed?\\n\\nNodes Executed is the aggregate number of nodes in a LangGraph application that are called and completed successfully during an invocation of the application. If a node in the graph is not called during execution or ends in an error state, these nodes will not be counted. If a node is called and completes successfully multiple times, each occurrence will be counted.What does uptime mean for LangGraph Platform usage?\\n\\nUptime is the duration your deployment’s database is live and persisting state. Uptime will be tracked as soon as your deployment is live and ends when you shut it down. Dev deployments are typically short-lived (used during iteration, then deleted) – whereas Production deployments stay live and are updated via revisions (rather than being deleted).\\xa0When should I use a dev-sized deployment vs. a production-sized deployment?\\n\\nWe recommend using the production-sized deployment for any customer-facing agent. Dev-sized deployments are intended for testing and do not support horizontal scaling, backups, or performance optimizations needed in production.Ready to start shipping \\u2028reliable agents faster?Get started with tools from the LangChain product suite for every step of the agent development lifecycle.Get a demoSign up for freeProductsLangChainLangSmithLangGraphResourcesGuidesBlogCustomer StoriesLangChain AcademyCommunityEventsChangelogDocsCompanyAboutCareersXLinkedInYouTubeMarketing AssetsSecuritySign up for our newsletter to stay up to dateThank you!

You will have 1 free seat with access to LangSmith (5k base traces/month included).\\xa0\\xa0\\u200dThe Plus plan is for teams that want to self-serve with moderate usage and collaboration needs. You can purchase up to 10 seats with access to LangSmith (10k base traces/month included). You will be able to ship agents with our managed LangGraph Platform Cloud service, with 1 free dev-sized deployment included.\\xa0\\u200dThe Enterprise plan is for teams that need more advanced administration, security, support, or deployment options. Contact our sales team to learn more.Do you offer a plan for startups?\\n\\nYes! We offer a Startup Plan for LangSmith, designed for early-stage companies building agentic applications. You’ll get discounted rates and generous free trace allotments to build with confidence from day one.\\u200d\\u200dApply here to get started with startup pricing. Customers can stay on the Startup Plan for 2 years before graduating to the Plus Plan.When will I be billed?\\n\\nFor the Developer or Plus Plan, seats are billed monthly on the 1st or pro-rated if added mid-month (no credit for removed seats); traces are billed monthly in arrears for your usage. Enterprise plans are invoiced annually upfront.Will you train on the data that I send to LangSmith or LangGraph Platform?\\n\\nWe will not train on your data, and you own all rights to your data. See our Terms of Service for more information.LangSmith QuestionsWhat is a trace? Can it contain multiple events?\\n\\nA trace represents a single execution of your application—whether it’s an agent, evaluator, or playground session. It can include many individual steps, such as LLM calls and other tracked events. Here\\'s an example of a single trace.What is the difference between a base trace and an extended trace?\\n\\nBase traces have a shorter retention period of 14 days and cost $0.50 per 1k traces. Extended traces have a longer retention period of 400 days and cost $5.00 per 1k traces. You can \"upgrade\" base traces to extended traces at $4.50 per 1k traces.Why might I want to upgrade a base trace to an extended trace?\\n\\nBase traces are short-lived (14-day retention) and ideal for quick debugging or ad-hoc analysis. They’re priced for volume and short-term utility.\\u200dExtended traces, on the other hand, are retained for 400 days and often include valuable feedback—whether from users, evaluators, or human labelers. This feedback makes them essential for ongoing improvement and model tuning (higher utility), which comes with a higher price point.\\u200dLangSmith lets you choose the right retention for each trace, helping you balance cost and value.

Just as telling an actor to “be a pirate” determines how they act, a prompt provides instructions, examples, and context that shape how the model responds.\\nPrompt engineering is important because it allows you to change the way the model behaves. While there are other ways to change the model’s behavior (like fine-tuning), prompt engineering is usually the simplest to get started with and often provides the highest ROI.\\nWe often see that prompt engineering is multi-disciplinary. Sometimes the best prompt engineer is not the software engineer who is building the application, but rather the product manager or another domain expert. It is important to have the proper tooling and infrastructure to support this cross-disciplinary building.\\n\\u200bPrompts vs. prompt templates\\nAlthough we often use these terms interchangably, it is important to understand the difference between “prompts” and “prompt templates”.\\nPrompts refer to the messages that are passed into the language model.\\nPrompt Templates refer to a way of formatting information to get that prompt to hold the information that you want. Prompt templates can include variables for few shot examples, outside context, or any other external data that is needed in your prompt.\\n\\n\\u200bPrompts in LangSmith\\nYou can store and version prompts templates in LangSmith. There are few key aspects of a prompt template to understand.\\n\\u200bChat vs Completion\\nThere are two different types of prompts: chat style prompts and completion style prompts.\\nChat style prompts are a list of messages. This is the prompting style supported by most model APIs these days, and so this should generally be preferred.\\nCompletion style prompts are just a string. This is an older style of prompting, and so mostly exists for legacy reasons.\\n\\u200bF-string vs. mustache\\nYou can format your prompt with input variables using either f-string or mustache format. Here is an example prompt with f-string format:\\nCopyHello, {name}!\\n\\nAnd here is one with mustache:\\nCopyHello, {{name}}!\\n\\nTo add a conditional mustache prompt:\\nCopy{{#is_logged_in}}  Welcome back, {{name}}!{{else}}  Please log in.{{/is_logged_in}}\\n\\n\\nThe playground UI will pick up is_logged_in variable, but any nested variables you’ll need to specify yourself. Paste the following into inputs to ensure the above conditional prompt works:\\n\\nCopy{  \"name\": \"Alice\"}\\n\\nThe LangSmith Playground uses f-string as the default template format, but you can switch to mustache format in the prompt settings/template format section. mustache gives you more flexibility around conditional variables, loops, and nested keys. For conditional variables, you’ll need to manually add json variables in the ‘inputs’ section. Read the documentation\\n\\u200bTools\\nTools are interfaces the LLM can use to interact with the outside world. Tools consist of a name, description, and JSON schema of arguments used to call the tool.\\n\\u200bStructured output\\nStructured output is a feature of most state of the art LLMs, wherein instead of producing raw text as output they stick to a specified schema. This may or may not use Tools under the hood.\\nStructured outputs are similar to tools, but different in a few key ways. With tools, the LLM choose which tool to call (or may choose not to call any); with structured output, the LLM always responds in this format. With tools, the LLM may select multiple tools; with structured output, only one response is generate.\\n\\u200bModel\\nOptionally, you can store a model configuration alongside a prompt template. This includes the name of the model and any other parameters (temperature, etc).\\n\\u200bPrompt versioning\\nVerisioning is a key part of iterating and collaborating on your different prompts.\\n\\u200bCommits\\nEvery saved update to a prompt creates a new commit. You can view previous commits, making it easy to review earlier prompt versions or revert to a previous state if needed. In the SDK, you can access a specific commit of a prompt by specifying the commit hash along with the prompt name (e.g. prompt_name:commit_hash).\\nIn the UI, you can compare a commit with its previous version by toggling the “diff” button in the top-right corner of the Commits tab.\\n\\n\\u200bTags\\nYou may want to tag prompt commits with a human-readable tag so that you can refer to it even as new commits are added. Common use cases include tagging a prompt with dev or prod tags. This allows you to track which versions of prompts are used where.\\n\\u200bPrompt playground\\nThe prompt playground makes the process of iterating and testing your prompts seamless. You can enter the playground from the sidebar or directly from a saved prompt.\\nIn the playground you can:\\n\\nChange the model being used\\nChange prompt template being used\\nChange the output schema\\nChange the tools available\\nEnter the input variables to run through the prompt template\\nRun the prompt through the model\\nObserve the outputs\\n\\n\\u200bTesting multiple prompts\\nYou can add more prompts to your playground to easily compare outputs and decide which version is better:\\n\\n\\u200bTesting over a dataset\\nTo test over a dataset, you simply select the dataset from the top right and press Start. You can modify whether the results are streamed back as well as how many repitions there are in the test.\\n\\nYou can click on the “View Experiment” button to dive deeper into the results of the test.\\n\\u200bVideo guide\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOverviewCreate a prompt⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

You can deploy a model server that exposes your model’s API via , an open source library for serving LangChain applications. Behind the scenes, the playground will interact with your model server to generate responses.\\n\\u200bDeploy a custom model server\\nFor your convenience, we have provided a sample model server that you can use as a reference. You can find the sample model server here We highly recommend using the sample model server as a starting point.\\nDepending on your model is an instruct-style or chat-style model, you will need to implement either custom_model.py or custom_chat_model.py respectively.\\n\\u200bAdding configurable fields\\nIt is often useful to configure your model with different parameters.

This page describes the following features:\\n\\nCommit tags for version control and environment management.\\nWebhook triggers for automating workflows when prompts are updated.\\nPublic prompt hub for discovering and using community-created prompts.\\n\\n\\u200bCommit tags\\nCommit tags are labels that reference a specific commit in your prompt’s version history. They help you mark significant versions and control which versions run in different environments. By referencing tags rather than commit IDs in your code, you can update which version is being used without modifying the code itself.\\nEach tag references exactly one commit, though you can reassign a tag to point to a different commit.\\nUse cases for commit tags can include:\\n\\nEnvironment-specific tags: Mark commits for production or staging environments, which allows you to switch between different versions without changing your code.\\nVersion control: Mark stable versions of your prompts, for example, v1, v2, which lets you reference specific versions in your code and track changes over time.\\nCollaboration: Mark versions ready for review, which enables you to share specific versions with collaborators and get feedback.\\n\\n\\u200bCreate a tag\\nTo create a tag, navigate to the Commits tab for a prompt. Click on the tag icon next to the commit you want to tag. Click New Tag and enter a name for the tag.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bMove a tag\\nTo point a tag to a different commit, click on the tag icon next to the destination commit, and select the tag you want to move. This will automatically update the tag to point to the new commit.\\n\\n\\u200bDelete a tag\\nTo delete a tag, click on the delete icon next to the tag you want to delete. This will delete the tag altogether and it will no longer be associated with any commit.\\n\\u200bUse tags in code\\nTags provide a stable way to reference specific versions of your prompts in code. Instead of using commit hashes directly, you can reference tags that can be updated without changing your code.\\nHere is an example of pulling a prompt by tag in Python:\\nCopyprompt = client.pull_prompt(\"joke-generator:prod\")\\n# If prod tag points to commit a1b2c3d4, this is equivalent to:\\nprompt = client.pull_prompt(\"joke-generator:a1b2c3d4\")\\n\\nFor more information on how to use prompts in code, refer to Managing prompts programmatically.\\n\\u200bTrigger a webhook on prompt commit\\nYou can configure a webhook to be triggered whenever a commit is made to a prompt.\\nSome common use cases of this include:\\n\\nTriggering a CI/CD pipeline when prompts are updated.\\nSynchronizing prompts with a GitHub repository.\\nNotifying team members about prompt modifications.\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure a webhook\\nNavigate to the Prompts section in the left-hand sidebar or from the application homepage. In the top right corner, click on the + Webhook button.\\nAdd a webhook URL and any required headers.\\nYou can only configure one webhook per workspace. If you want to configure multiple per workspace or set up a different webhook for each prompt, let us know in the LangChain Forum.\\nTo test out your webhook, click the Send test notification button. This will send a test notification to the webhook URL you provided with a sample payload.\\nThe sample payload is a JSON object with the following fields:\\n\\nprompt_id: The ID of the prompt that was committed.\\nprompt_name: The name of the prompt that was committed.\\ncommit_hash: The commit hash of the prompt.\\ncreated_at: The date of the commit.\\ncreated_by: The author of the commit.\\nmanifest: The manifest of the prompt.\\n\\n\\u200bTrigger the webhook\\nCommit to a prompt to trigger the webhook you’ve configured.\\n\\u200bUse the Playground\\nIf you do this in the Playground, you’ll be prompted to deselect the webhooks you’d like to avoid triggering.\\n\\n\\u200bUsing the API\\nIf you commit via the API, you can specify to skip triggering the webhook by setting the skip_webhooks parameter to true or to an array of webhook ids to ignore. Refer to the API docs for more information.\\n\\u200bPublic prompt hub\\nLangSmith’s public prompt hub is a collection of prompts that have been created by the LangChain community that you can use for reference.\\nNote that prompts are user-generated and unverified. LangChain does not review or endorse public prompts, use these at your own risk. Use of Prompt Hub is subject to our Terms of Service.\\nNavigate to the Prompts section of the left-hand sidebar and click on Browse all Public Prompts in the LangChain Hub.\\nHere you’ll find all of the publicly listed prompts in the LangChain Hub. You can search for prompts by name, handle, use cases, descriptions, or models. You can fork prompts to your personal organization, view the prompt’s details, and run the prompt in the Playground. You can pull any public prompt into your code using the SDK.\\nTo view prompts tied to your workspace, visit the Prompts tab in the sidebar.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsCreate a promptManage prompts programmatically⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

For all other functionality, use the LangSmith package.\\npipuvTypeScriptCopypip install -U langsmith # version >= 0.1.99\\npip install -U langchain langsmith # langsmith version >= 0.1.99 and langchain >= 0.2.13\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure environment variables\\nIf you already have LANGSMITH_API_KEY set to your current workspace’s api key from LangSmith, you can skip this step.\\nOtherwise, get an API key for your workspace by navigating to Settings > API Keys > Create API Key in LangSmith.\\nSet your environment variable.\\nCopyexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"lsv2_...\"\\n\\nWhat we refer to as “prompts” used to be called “repos”, so any references to “repo” in the code are referring to a prompt.\\n\\u200bPush a prompt\\nTo create a new prompt or update an existing prompt, you can use the push prompt method.\\nPythonLangChain (Python)TypeScriptCopyfrom langsmith import Client\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\n\\nclient = Client()\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"tell me a joke about {topic}\")\\nurl = client.push_prompt(\"joke-generator\", object=prompt)\\n# url is a link to the prompt in the UI\\nprint(url)\\n\\nYou can also push a prompt as a RunnableSequence of a prompt and a model. This is useful for storing the model configuration you want to use with this prompt. The provider must be supported by the LangSmith playground.

In these cases, you’ll want to include multimodal content in your prompt and test the model’s ability to answer questions about the content.\\nThe LangSmith Playground supports two methods for incorporating multimodal content in your prompts:\\n\\n\\nInline content: Embed static files (images, PDFs, audio) directly in your prompt. This is ideal when you want to consistently include the same multimodal content across all uses of the prompt. For example, you might include a reference image that helps ground the model’s responses.\\n\\n\\nTemplate variables: Create dynamic placeholders for attachments that can be populated with different content each time. This approach offers more flexibility, allowing you to:\\n\\nTest how the model handles different inputs\\nCreate reusable prompts that work with varying content\\n\\n\\n\\nNot all models support multimodal content. Before using multimodal features in the playground, make sure your selected model supports the file types you want to use.\\n\\u200bInline content\\nClick the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content.

Once you get to your tracing project simply open the run, select the LLM call, and open it in the playground as follows:\\n\\nYou can then edit the system prompt, tweak the tools and/or output schema and observe how the output of the multi-turn conversation changes.\\n\\u200bFrom a dataset\\nBefore starting, make sure you have set up your dataset. Since you want to evaluate multi-turn conversations, make sure there is a key in your inputs that contains a list of messages.\\nOnce you have created your dataset, head to the playground and load your dataset to evaluate.\\nThen, add a messages list variable to your prompt, making sure to name it the same as the key in your inputs that contains the list of messages:\\n\\nWhen you run your prompt, the messages from each example will be added as a list in place of the ‘Messages List’ variable.\\n\\u200bManually\\nThere are two ways to manually create multi-turn conversations. The first way is by simply appending messages to the prompt:\\n\\nThis is helpful for quick iteration, but is rigid since the multi-turn conversation is hardcoded. Instead, if you want your prompt to work with any multi-turn conversation you can add a ‘Messages List’ variable and add your multi-turn conversation there:\\n\\nThis allows you to just tweak the system prompt or the tools, while allowing any multi-turn conversation to take the place of the Messages List variable, allowing you to reuse this prompt across various runs.\\n\\u200bNext Steps\\nNow that you know how to set up the playground for multi-turn interactions, you can either manually inspect and judge the outputs, or you can add evaluators to classify results.\\nYou can also read these how-to guides to learn more about how to use the playground to run evaluations.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsSync prompts with GitHub⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

In the LangSmith playground, you can use two types of tools:\\n\\n\\nBuilt-in tools: Pre-configured tools provided by model providers (like OpenAI and Anthropic) that are ready to use. These include capabilities like web search, code interpretation, and more.\\n\\n\\nCustom tools: Functions you define to perform specific tasks. These are useful when you need to integrate with your own systems or create specialized functionality. When you define custom tools within the LangSmith Playground, you can verify that the model correctly identifies and calls these tools with the correct arguments. Soon we plan to support executing these custom tool calls directly.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bWhen to use tools\\n\\n\\nUse built-in tools when you need common capabilities like web search or code interpretation.

Classifiers are great to optimize because its generally pretty simple to collect the desired output, which makes it easy to create few shot examples based on user feedback. That is exactly what we will do in this example.\\n\\u200bThe objective\\nIn this example, we will build a bot that classify GitHub issues based on their title. It will take in a title and classify it into one of many different classes. Then, we will start to collect user feedback and use that to shape how this classifier performs.\\n\\u200bGetting started\\nTo get started, we will first set it up so that we send all traces to a specific project. We can do this by setting an environment variable:\\nCopyimport os\\nos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = \"classifier\"\\n\\nWe can then create our initial application. This will be a really simple function that just takes in a GitHub issue title and tries to label it.\\nCopyimport openai\\nfrom langsmith import traceable, Client\\nimport uuid\\n\\nclient = openai.Client()\\n\\navailable_topics = [\\n    \"bug\",\\n    \"improvement\",\\n    \"new_feature\",\\n    \"documentation\",\\n    \"integration\",\\n]\\n\\nprompt_template = \"\"\"Classify the type of the issue as one of {topics}.\\nIssue: {text}\"\"\"\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"chain\",\\n    name=\"Classifier\",\\n)\\ndef topic_classifier(\\n    topic: str):\\n    return client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\\n                \"role\": \"user\",\\n                \"content\": prompt_template.format(\\n                    topics=\\',\\'.join(available_topics),\\n                    text=topic,\\n                )\\n            }\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n\\nWe can then start to interact with it. When interacting with it, we will generate the LangSmith run id ahead of time and pass that into this function. We do this so we can attach feedback later on.\\nHere’s how we can invoke the application:\\nCopyrun_id = uuid.uuid4()\\ntopic_classifier(\\n    \"fix bug in LCEL\",\\n    langsmith_extra={\"run_id\": run_id})\\n\\nHere’s how we can attach feedback after. We can collect feedback in two forms.\\nFirst, we can collect “positive” feedback - this is for examples that the model got right.\\nCopyls_client = Client()\\nrun_id = uuid.uuid4()\\ntopic_classifier(\\n    \"fix bug in LCEL\",\\n    langsmith_extra={\"run_id\": run_id})\\nls_client.create_feedback(\\n    run_id,\\n    key=\"user-score\",\\n    score=1.0,\\n)\\n\\nNext, we can focus on collecting feedback that corresponds to a “correction” to the generation. In this example the model will classify it as a bug, whereas I really want this to be classified as documentation.\\nCopyls_client = Client()\\nrun_id = uuid.uuid4()\\ntopic_classifier(\\n    \"fix bug in documentation\",\\n    langsmith_extra={\"run_id\": run_id})\\nls_client.create_feedback(\\n    run_id,\\n    key=\"correction\",\\n    correction=\"documentation\")\\n\\n\\u200bSet up automations\\nWe can now set up automations to move examples with feedback of some form into a dataset. We will set up two automations, one for positive feedback and the other for negative feedback.\\nThe first will take all runs with positive feedback and automatically add them to a dataset. The logic behind this is that any run with positive feedback we can use as a good example in future iterations. Let’s create a dataset called classifier-github-issues to add this data to.\\n\\nThe second will take all runs with a correction and use a webhook to add them to a dataset. When creating this webhook, we will select the option to “Use Corrections”. This option will make it so that when creating a dataset from a run, rather than using the output of the run as the gold-truth output of the datapoint, it will use the correction.\\n\\n\\u200bUpdate the application\\nWe can now update our code to pull down the dataset we are sending runs to. Once we pull it down, we can create a string with the examples in it. We can then put this string as part of the prompt!\\nCopy### NEW CODE ###\\n# Initialize the LangSmith Client so we can use to get the dataset\\nls_client = Client()\\n\\n# Create a function that will take in a list of examples and format them into a string\\ndef create_example_string(examples):\\n    final_strings = []\\n    for e in examples:\\n        final_strings.append(f\"Input: {e.inputs[\\'topic\\']}\\\\n> {e.outputs[\\'output\\']}\")\\n    return \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(final_strings)\\n### NEW CODE ###\\n\\nclient = openai.Client()\\n\\navailable_topics = [\\n    \"bug\",\\n    \"improvement\",\\n    \"new_feature\",\\n    \"documentation\",\\n    \"integration\",\\n]\\n\\nprompt_template = \"\"\"Classify the type of the issue as one of {topics}.\\n\\nHere are some examples:\\n{examples}\\n\\nBegin!\\nIssue: {text}\\n>\"\"\"\\n\\n@traceable(\\n    run_type=\"chain\",\\n    name=\"Classifier\",\\n)\\ndef topic_classifier(\\n    topic: str):\\n    # We can now pull down the examples from the dataset\\n    # We do this inside the function so it always get the most up-to-date examples,\\n    # But this can be done outside and cached for speed if desired\\n    examples = list(ls_client.list_examples(dataset_name=\"classifier-github-issues\"))  # <- New Code\\n    example_string = create_example_string(examples)\\n    return client.chat.completions.create(\\n        model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\\n        temperature=0,\\n        messages=[\\n            {\\n                \"role\": \"user\",\\n                \"content\": prompt_template.format(\\n                    topics=\\',\\'.join(available_topics),\\n                    text=topic,\\n                    examples=example_string,\\n                )\\n            }\\n        ],\\n    ).choices[0].message.content\\n\\nIf now run the application with a similar input as before, we can see that it correctly learns that anything related to docs (even if a bug) should be classified as documentation\\nCopyls_client = Client()\\nrun_id = uuid.uuid4()\\ntopic_classifier(\\n    \"address bug in documentation\",\\n    langsmith_extra={\"run_id\": run_id})\\n\\n\\u200bSemantic search over examples\\nOne additional thing we can do is only use the most semantically similar examples.

This could be the same repository as your application code or a dedicated one for prompts.\\n\\n\\nGitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):\\n\\nLangSmith webhooks don’t directly interact with GitHub—they call an intermediary server that you create.\\nThis server requires a GitHub PAT to authenticate and make commits to your repository.\\nMust include the repo scope (public_repo is sufficient for public repositories).\\nGo to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic).\\nClick Generate new token (classic).\\nName it (e.g., “LangSmith Prompt Sync”), set an expiration, and select the required scopes.\\nClick Generate token and copy it immediately — it won’t be shown again.\\nStore the token securely and provide it as an environment variable to your server.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bUnderstanding LangSmith “Prompt Commits” and Webhooks\\nIn LangSmith, when you save changes to a prompt, you’re essentially creating a new version or a “Prompt Commit.” These commits are what can trigger webhooks.\\nThe webhook will send a JSON payload containing the new prompt manifest.\\nSample Webhook PayloadCopy{\\n  \"prompt_id\": \"f33dcb51-eb17-47a5-83ca-64ac8a027a29\",\\n  \"prompt_name\": \"My Prompt\",\\n  \"commit_hash\": \"commit_hash_1234567890\",\\n  \"created_at\": \"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\\n  \"created_by\": \"Jane Doe\",\\n  \"manifest\": {\\n    \"lc\": 1,\\n    \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n    \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"runnable\", \"RunnableSequence\"],\\n    \"kwargs\": {\\n      \"first\": {\\n        \"lc\": 1,\\n        \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n        \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"prompts\", \"chat\", \"ChatPromptTemplate\"],\\n        \"kwargs\": {\\n          \"messages\": [\\n            {\\n              \"lc\": 1,\\n              \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n              \"id\": [\\n                \"langchain_core\",\\n                \"prompts\",\\n                \"chat\",\\n                \"SystemMessagePromptTemplate\"\\n              ],\\n              \"kwargs\": {\\n                \"prompt\": {\\n                  \"lc\": 1,\\n                  \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n                  \"id\": [\\n                    \"langchain_core\",\\n                    \"prompts\",\\n                    \"prompt\",\\n                    \"PromptTemplate\"\\n                  ],\\n                  \"kwargs\": {\\n                    \"input_variables\": [],\\n                    \"template_format\": \"mustache\",\\n                    \"template\": \"You are a chatbot.\"\\n                  }\\n                }\\n              }\\n            },\\n            {\\n              \"lc\": 1,\\n              \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n              \"id\": [\\n                \"langchain_core\",\\n                \"prompts\",\\n                \"chat\",\\n                \"HumanMessagePromptTemplate\"\\n              ],\\n              \"kwargs\": {\\n                \"prompt\": {\\n                  \"lc\": 1,\\n                  \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n                  \"id\": [\\n                    \"langchain_core\",\\n                    \"prompts\",\\n                    \"prompt\",\\n                    \"PromptTemplate\"\\n                  ],\\n                  \"kwargs\": {\\n                    \"input_variables\": [\"question\"],\\n                    \"template_format\": \"mustache\",\\n                    \"template\": \"{{question}}\"\\n                  }\\n                }\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ],\\n          \"input_variables\": [\"question\"]\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"last\": {\\n        \"lc\": 1,\\n        \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n        \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"schema\", \"runnable\", \"RunnableBinding\"],\\n        \"kwargs\": {\\n          \"bound\": {\\n            \"lc\": 1,\\n            \"type\": \"constructor\",\\n            \"id\": [\"langchain\", \"chat_models\", \"openai\", \"ChatOpenAI\"],\\n            \"kwargs\": {\\n              \"temperature\": 1,\\n              \"top_p\": 1,\\n              \"presence_penalty\": 0,\\n              \"frequency_penalty\": 0,\\n              \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-mini\",\\n              \"extra_headers\": {},\\n              \"openai_api_key\": {\\n                \"id\": [\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"],\\n                \"lc\": 1,\\n                \"type\": \"secret\"\\n              }\\n            }\\n          },\\n          \"kwargs\": {}\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nIt’s important to understand that LangSmith webhooks for prompt commits are generally triggered at the workspace level. This means if any prompt within your LangSmith workspace is modified and a “prompt commit” is saved, the webhook will fire and send the updated manifest of the prompt. The payloads are identifiable by prompt id. Your receiving server should be designed with this in mind.\\n\\u200bImplementing a FastAPI Server for Webhook Reception\\nTo effectively process webhook notifications from LangSmith when prompts are updated, an intermediary server application is necessary. This server will act as the receiver for HTTP POST requests sent by LangSmith. For demonstration purposes in this guide, we will outline the creation of a simple FastAPI application to fulfill this role.\\nThis publicly accessible server will be responsible for:\\n\\nReceiving Webhook Requests: Listening for incoming HTTP POST requests.\\nParsing Payloads: Extracting and interpreting the JSON-formatted prompt manifest from the request body.\\nCommitting to GitHub: Programmatically creating a new commit in your specified GitHub repository, containing the updated prompt manifest. This ensures your prompts remain version-controlled and synchronized with changes made in LangSmith.\\n\\nFor deployment, platforms like Render.com (offering a suitable free tier), Vercel, Fly.io, or other cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) can be utilized to host the FastAPI application and obtain a public URL.\\nThe server’s core functionality will include an endpoint for webhook reception, logic for parsing the manifest, and integration with the GitHub API (using a Personal Access Token for authentication) to manage commits.\\nMinimal FastAPI Server Code ()main.pyThis server will listen for incoming webhooks from LangSmith and commit the received prompt manifest to your GitHub repository.Copyimport base64\\nimport json\\nimport uuid\\nfrom typing import Any, Dict\\nimport httpx\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Body\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\nfrom pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict\\n\\n# --- Configuration ---\\nclass AppConfig(BaseSettings):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Application configuration model.\\n    Loads settings from environment variables.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    GITHUB_TOKEN: str\\n    GITHUB_REPO_OWNER: str\\n    GITHUB_REPO_NAME: str\\n    GITHUB_FILE_PATH: str = \"prompt_manifest.json\"\\n    GITHUB_BRANCH: str = \"main\"\\n    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(\\n        env_file=\".env\",\\n        env_file_encoding=\\'utf-8\\',\\n        extra=\\'ignore\\'\\n    )\\n\\nsettings = AppConfig()\\n\\n# --- Pydantic Models ---\\nclass WebhookPayload(BaseModel):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Defines the expected structure of the incoming webhook payload.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    prompt_id: UUID = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"The unique identifier for the prompt.\"\\n    )\\n    prompt_name: str = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"The name/title of the prompt.\"\\n    )\\n    commit_hash: str = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"An identifier for the commit event that triggered the webhook.\"\\n    )\\n    created_at: str = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"Timestamp indicating when the event was created (ISO format preferred).\"\\n    )\\n    created_by: str = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"The name of the user who created the event.\"\\n    )\\n    manifest: Dict[str, Any] = Field(\\n        ...,\\n        description=\"The main content or configuration data to be committed to GitHub.\"\\n    )\\n\\n# --- GitHub Helper Function ---\\nasync def commit_manifest_to_github(payload: WebhookPayload) -> Dict[str, Any]:\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Helper function to commit the manifest directly to the configured branch.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    github_api_base_url = \"https://api.github.com\"\\n    repo_file_url = (\\n        f\"{github_api_base_url}/repos/{settings.GITHUB_REPO_OWNER}/\"\\n        f\"{settings.GITHUB_REPO_NAME}/contents/{settings.GITHUB_FILE_PATH}\"\\n    )\\n    headers = {\\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {settings.GITHUB_TOKEN}\",\\n        \"Accept\": \"application/vnd.github.v3+json\",\\n        \"X-GitHub-Api-Version\": \"2022-11-28\",\\n    }\\n    manifest_json_string = json.dumps(payload.manifest, indent=2)\\n    content_base64 = base64.b64encode(manifest_json_string.encode(\\'utf-8\\')).decode(\\'utf-8\\')\\n    commit_message = f\"feat: Update {settings.GITHUB_FILE_PATH} via webhook -

Run with Uvicorn: uvicorn main:app --reload\\n# 4. Deploy to a public platform like Render.com.\\nKey aspects of this server:\\nConfiguration (.env): It expects a .env file with your GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER, and GITHUB_REPO_NAME. You can also customize GITHUB_FILE_PATH (default: LangSmith_prompt_manifest.json) and GITHUB_BRANCH (default: main).\\nGitHub Interaction: The commit_manifest_to_github function handles the logic of fetching the current file’s SHA (to update it) and then committing the new manifest content.\\nWebhook Endpoint (/webhook/commit): This is the URL path your LangSmith webhook will target.\\nError Handling: Basic error handling for GitHub API interactions is included.\\nDeploy this server to your chosen platform (e.g., Render) and note down its public URL (e.g., https://prompt-commit-webhook.onrender.com).\\n\\u200bConfiguring the Webhook in LangSmith\\nOnce your FastAPI server is deployed and you have its public URL, you can configure the webhook in LangSmith:\\n\\n\\nNavigate to your LangSmith workspace.\\n\\n\\nGo to the Prompts section. Here you’ll see a list of your prompts.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the top right of the Prompts page, click the + Webhook button.\\n\\n\\nYou’ll be presented with a form to configure your webhook:\\n\\n\\nWebhook URL: Enter the full public URL of your deployed FastAPI server’s endpoint. For our example server, this would be https://prompt-commit-webhook.onrender.com/webhook/commit.\\nHeaders (Optional):\\n\\nYou can add custom headers that LangSmith will send with each webhook request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTest the Webhook: LangSmith provides a “Send Test Notification” button. Use this to send a sample payload to your server. Check your server logs (e.g., on Render) to ensure it receives the request and processes it successfully (or to debug any issues).\\n\\n\\nSave the webhook configuration.\\n\\n\\n\\u200bThe Workflow in Action\\n\\nNow, with everything set up, here’s what happens:\\n\\n\\nPrompt Modification: A user (developer or non-technical team member) modifies a prompt in the LangSmith UI and saves it, creating a new “prompt commit.”\\n\\n\\nWebhook Trigger: LangSmith detects this new prompt commit and triggers the configured webhook.\\n\\n\\nHTTP Request: LangSmith sends an HTTP POST request to the public URL of your FastAPI server (e.g., https://prompt-commit-webhook.onrender.com/webhook/commit). The body of this request contains the JSON prompt manifest for the entire workspace.\\n\\n\\nServer Receives Payload: Your FastAPI server’s endpoint receives the request.\\n\\n\\nGitHub Commit: The server parses the JSON manifest from the request body. It then uses the configured GitHub Personal Access Token, repository owner, repository name, file path, and branch to:\\n\\nCheck if the manifest file already exists in the repository on the specified branch to get its SHA (this is necessary for updating an existing file).\\nCreate a new commit with the latest prompt manifest, either creating the file or updating it if it already exists. The commit message will indicate that it’s an update from LangSmith.\\n\\n\\n\\nConfirmation: You should see the new commit appear in your GitHub repository.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’ve now successfully synced your LangSmith prompts with GitHub!\\n\\u200bBeyond a Simple Commit\\nOur example FastAPI server performs a direct commit of the entire prompt manifest. However, this is just the starting point. You can extend the server’s functionality to perform more sophisticated actions:\\n\\nGranular Commits: Parse the manifest and commit changes to individual prompt files if you prefer a more granular structure in your repository.\\nTrigger CI/CD: Instead of (or in addition to) committing, have the server trigger a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to deploy a staging environment, run tests, or build new application versions.\\nUpdate Databases/Caches: If your application loads prompts from a database or cache, update these stores directly.\\nNotifications: Send notifications to Slack, email, or other communication channels about prompt changes.\\nSelective Processing: Based on metadata within the LangSmith payload (if available, e.g., which specific prompt changed or by whom), you could apply different logic.\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsOptimize a classifierTest multi-turn conversations⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If the target field is marked as required, and no matching message is found upon entry, it will attempt to extract a message (or list of messages) from several well-known LangSmith tracing formats (e.g., any traced LangChain BaseChatModel run or traced run from the LangSmith OpenAI wrapper), and remove the original key containing the message.convert_to_openai_toolArray[Tool] Only available on top level fields in the inputs dictionary.Converts any incoming data into OpenAI standard tool formats here using langchain’s convert_to_openai_tool Will extract tool definitions from a run’s invocation parameters if present / no tools are found at the specified key. This is useful because LangChain chat models trace tool definitions to the extra.invocation_params field of the run rather than inputs.remove_extra_fieldsObjectRemoves any field not defined in the schema for this target object.\\n\\u200bChat Model prebuilt schema\\nThe main use case for transformations is to simplify collecting production traces into datasets in a format that can be standardized across model providers for usage in evaluations / few shot prompting / etc downstream.\\nTo simplify setup of transformations for our end users, LangSmith offers a pre-defined schema that will do the following:\\n\\nExtract messages from your collected runs and transform them into the openai standard format, which makes them compatible all LangChain ChatModels and most model providers’ SDK for downstream evaluation and experimentation\\nExtract any tools used by your LLM and add them to your example’s input to be used for reproducability in downstream evaluation\\n\\nUsers who want to iterate on their system prompts often also add the Remove System Messages transformation on their input messages when using our Chat Model schema, which will prevent you from saving the system prompt to your dataset.\\n\\u200bCompatibility\\nThe LLM run collection schema is built to collect data from LangChain BaseChatModel runs or traced runs from the LangSmith OpenAI wrapper.\\nPlease reach out to support@langchain.dev if you have an LLM run you are tracing that is not compatible and we can extend support.\\nIf you want to apply transformations to other sorts of runs (for example, representing LangGraph state with message history), please define your schema directly and manually add the relevant transformations.\\n\\u200bEnablement\\nWhen adding a run from a tracing project or annotation queue to a dataset, if it has the LLM run type, we will apply the Chat Model schema by default.\\nFor enablement on new datasets, see our dataset management how-to guide.\\n\\u200bSpecs\\nFor the full API specs of the prebuilt schema, see the below sections:\\n\\u200bInput Schema\\nCopy{\\n  \"type\": \"object\",\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"messages\": {\\n      \"type\": \"array\",\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/public/schemas/v1/message.json\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \"tools\": {\\n      \"type\": \"array\",\\n      \"items\": {\\n        \"$ref\": \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/public/schemas/v1/tooldef.json\"\\n      }\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\"messages\"]\\n}\\n\\n\\u200bOutput Schema\\nCopy{\\n  \"type\": \"object\",\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"message\": {\\n      \"$ref\": \"https://api.smith.langchain.com/public/schemas/v1/message.json\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\"message\"]\\n}\\n\\n\\u200bTransformations\\nAnd the transformations look as follows:\\nCopy[\\n  {\\n    \"path\": [\"inputs\"],\\n    \"transformation_type\": \"remove_extra_fields\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"path\": [\"inputs\", \"messages\"],\\n    \"transformation_type\": \"convert_to_openai_message\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"path\": [\"inputs\", \"tools\"],\\n    \"transformation_type\": \"convert_to_openai_tool\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"path\": [\"outputs\"],\\n    \"transformation_type\": \"remove_extra_fields\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \"path\": [\"outputs\", \"message\"],\\n    \"transformation_type\": \"convert_to_openai_message\"\\n  }\\n]\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsDataset prebuilt JSON schema types⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

The default configuration for the self-hosted deployment can handle substantial load, and you can configure your deployment to be able to achieve higher scale. This page describes scaling considerations and provides some examples to help configure your self-hosted instance.\\nFor example configurations, refer to Example LangSmith configurations for scale.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nThe table below provides an overview comparing different LangSmith configurations for various load patterns (reads / writes):\\nLow / lowLow / highHigh / lowMedium / mediumHigh / highConcurrent frontend users55502050Traces submitted per second101000101001000Frontend replicas1 (default)4224Platform backend replicas3 (default)203 (default)3 (default)20Queue replicas3 (default)160610160Backend replicas2 (default)5401650Redis resources8 Gi (default)200 Gi external8 Gi (default)13Gi external200 Gi externalClickHouse resources4 CPU16 Gi (default)10 CPU32Gi memory8 CPU16 Gi per replica16 CPU24Gi memory14 CPU24 Gi per replicaClickHouse setupSingle instanceSingle instance3-node replicated clusterSingle instance3-node replicated clusterPostgres resources2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)Blob storageDisabledEnabledEnabledEnabledEnabled\\nBelow we go into more details about the read and write paths as well as provide a values.yaml snippet for you to start with for your self-hosted LangSmith instance.\\n\\u200bTrace ingestion (write path)\\nCommon usage that put load on the write path:\\n\\nIngesting traces via the Python or JavaScript LangSmith SDK\\nIngesting traces via the @traceable wrapper\\nSubmitting traces via the /runs/multipart endpoint\\n\\nServices that play a large role in trace ingestion:\\n\\nPlatform backend service: Receives initial request to ingest traces and places traces on a Redis queue\\nRedis cache: Used to queue traces that need to be persisted\\nQueue service: Persists traces for querying\\nClickHouse: Persistent storage used for traces\\n\\nWhen scaling up the write path (trace ingestion), it is helpful to monitor the four services/resources listed above. Here are some typical changes that can help increase performance of trace ingestion:\\n\\nGive ClickHouse more resources (CPU and memory) if it is approaching resource limits.\\nIncrease the number of platform-backend pods if ingest requests are taking long to respond.\\nIncrease queue service pod replicas if traces are not being processed from Redis fast enough.\\nUse a larger Redis cache if you notice that the current Redis instance is reaching resource limits. This could also be a reason why ingest requests take a long time.\\n\\n\\u200bTrace querying (read path)\\nCommon usage that puts load on the read path:\\n\\nUsers on the frontend looking at tracing projects or individual traces\\nScripts used to query for trace info\\nHitting either the /runs/query or /runs/<run-id> api endpoints\\n\\nServices that play a large role in querying traces:\\n\\nBackend service: Receives the request and submits a query to ClickHouse to then respond to the request\\nClickHouse: Persistent storage for traces. This is the main database that is queried when requesting trace info.\\n\\nWhen scaling up the read path (trace querying), it is helpful to monitor the two services/resources listed above. Here are some typical changes that can help improve performance of trace querying:\\n\\nIncrease the number of backend service pods. This would be most impactful if backend service pods are reaching 1 core CPU usage.\\nGive ClickHouse more resources (CPU or Memory). ClickHouse can be very resource intensive, but it should lead to better performance.\\nMove to a replicated ClickHouse cluster. Adding replicas of ClickHouse helps with read performance, but we recommend staying below 5 replicas (start with 3).\\n\\nFor more precise guidance on how this translates to helm chart values, refer to the examples the following section. If you are unsure why your LangSmith instance cannot handle a certain load pattern, contact the LangChain team.\\n\\u200bExample LangSmith configurations for scale\\nBelow we provide some example LangSmith configurations based on expected read and write loads.\\nFor read load (trace querying):\\n\\nLow means roughly 5 users looking at traces at a time (about 10 requests per second)\\nMedium means roughly 20 users looking at traces at a time (about 40 requests per second)\\nHigh means roughly 50 users looking at traces at a time (about 100 requests per second)\\n\\nFor write load (trace ingestion):\\n\\nLow means up to 10 traces submitted per second\\nMedium means up to 100 traces submitted per second\\nHigh means up to 1000 traces submitted per second\\n\\nThe exact optimal configuration depends on your usage and trace payloads. Use the examples below in combination with the information above and your specific usage to update your LangSmith configuration as you see fit. If you have any questions, please reach out to the LangChain team.\\n\\u200bLow reads, low writes \\nThe default LangSmith configuration will handle this load. No custom resource configuration is needed here.\\n\\u200bLow reads, high writes \\nYou have a very high scale of trace ingestions, but single digit number of users on the frontend querying traces at any one time.\\nFor this, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage.

See our external ClickHouse doc for more guidance on how to setup a replicated ClickHouse cluster. For this load pattern, we recommend using a 3 node replicated setup, where each replica in the cluster should have resource requests of 8+ cores and 16+ GB memory, and resource limit of 12 cores and 32 GB memory.\\nFor this, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage.

See our external ClickHouse doc for more guidance on how to set up a replicated ClickHouse cluster. For this load pattern, we recommend using a 3 node replicated setup, where each replica in the cluster should have resource requests of 14+ cores and 24+ GB memory, and resource limit of 20 cores and 48 GB memory. We also recommend that each node/instance of ClickHouse has 600 Gi of volume storage for each day of TTL that you enable (as per the configuration below).\\nOverall, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage.

After deployment, all of the pods in the Kubernetes cluster should be in a Running state. Pods stuck in Pending may indicate that you are reaching node pool limits or need larger nodes.Also, ensure that any ingress controller deployed on the cluster is able to handle the desired load to prevent bottlenecks.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsLangSmith-managed ClickHouseEnable TTL & data retention⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you so choose, you can instead store this information in blob storage, which has a couple of notable benefits. For the best results in production deployments, we strongly recommend using blob storage, which offers the following benefits:\\n\\nIn high trace environments, inputs, outputs, errors, manifests, extras, and events may balloon the size of your databases.\\nIf using LangSmith Managed ClickHouse, you may want sensitive information in blob storage that resides in your environment. To alleviate this, LangSmith supports storing run inputs, outputs, errors, manifests, extras, events, and attachments in an external blob storage system.\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\nAzure blob storage is available in Helm chart versions 0.8.9 and greater. Deleting trace projects is supported in Azure starting in Helm chart version 0.10.43.\\n\\n\\nAccess to a valid blob storage service\\n\\nAmazon S3\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Storage (GCS)\\n\\n\\nAzure Blob Storage\\n\\n\\n\\nA bucket/directory in your blob storage to store the data. We highly recommend creating a separate bucket/directory for LangSmith data.\\n\\nIf you are using TTLs, you will need to set up a lifecycle policy to delete old data. You can find more information on configuring TTLs here. These policies should mirror the TTLs you have set in your LangSmith configuration, or you may experience data loss. See here on how to setup the lifecycle rules for TTLs for blob storage.\\n\\n\\n\\nCredentials to permit LangSmith Services to access the bucket/directory\\n\\nYou will need to provide your LangSmith instance with the necessary credentials to access the bucket/directory. Read the authentication section below for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf using S3 or GCS, an API url for your blob storage service\\n\\nThis will be the URL that LangSmith uses to access your blob storage system\\nFor Amazon S3, this will be the URL of the S3 endpoint. Something like: https://s3.amazonaws.com or https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com if using a regional endpoint.\\nFor Google Cloud Storage, this will be the URL of the GCS endpoint. Something like: https://storage.googleapis.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bAuthentication\\n\\u200bAmazon S3\\nTo authenticate to Amazon S3, you will need to create an IAM policy granting the following permissions on your bucket.\\nCopy{\\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n  \"Statement\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n      \"Action\": [\\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\\n        \"s3:DeleteObject\",\\n        \"s3:ListBucket\"\\n      ],\\n      \"Resource\": [\\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name\",\\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\"\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nOnce you have the correct policy, there are three ways to authenticate with Amazon S3:\\n\\n\\n(Recommended) IAM Role for Service Account: You can create an IAM role for your LangSmith instance and attach the policy to that role. You can then provide the role to LangSmith. This is the recommended way to authenticate with Amazon S3 in production.\\n\\nYou will need to create an IAM role with the policy attached.\\nYou will need to allow LangSmith service accounts to assume the role. The langsmith-queue, langsmith-backend, and langsmith-platform-backend service accounts will need to be able to assume the role.\\nThe service account names will be different if you are using a custom release name. You can find the service account names by running kubectl get serviceaccounts in your cluster.\\n\\nYou will need to provide the role ARN to LangSmith. You can do this by adding the eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: \"<role_arn>\" annotation to the queue, backend, and platform-backend services in your Helm Chart installation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess Key and Secret Key: You can provide LangSmith with an access key and secret key. This is the simplest way to authenticate with Amazon S3. However, it is not recommended for production use as it is less secure.\\n\\nYou will need to create a user with the policy attached. Then you can provision an access key and secret key for that user.\\n\\n\\n\\nVPC Endpoint Access: You can enable access to your S3 bucket via a VPC endpoint, which allows traffic to flow securely from your VPC to your S3 bucket.\\n\\nYou’ll need to provision a VPC endpoint and configure it to allow access to your S3 bucket.\\nYou can refer to our public Terraform modules for guidance and an example of configuring this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bGoogle Cloud Storage\\nTo authenticate with Google Cloud Storage, you will need to create a service account with the necessary permissions to access your bucket.\\nYour service account will need the Storage Admin role or a custom role with equivalent permissions. This can be scoped to the bucket that LangSmith will be using.\\nOnce you have a provisioned service account, you will need to generate a HMAC key for that service account. This key and secret will be used to authenticate with Google Cloud Storage.\\n\\u200bAzure Blob Storage\\nTo authenticate with Azure Blob Storage, you will need to use one of the following methods to grant LangSmith workloads permission to access your container (listed in order of precedence):\\n\\nStorage account and access key\\nConnection string\\nWorkload identity (recommended), managed identity, or environment variables supported by DefaultAzureCredential. This is the default authentication method when configuration for either option above is not present.\\n\\nTo use workload identity, add the label azure.workload.identity/use: true to the queue, backend, and platform-backend deployments. Additionally, add the azure.workload.identity/client-id annotation to the corresponding service accounts, which should be an existing Azure AD Application’s client ID or user-assigned managed identity’s client ID. See Azure’s documentation for additional details.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome deployments may need further customization of the connection configuration using a Service URL Override instead of the default service URL (https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/). For example, this override is necessary in order to use a different blob storage domain (e.g. government or china).\\n\\u200bCH Search\\nBy default, LangSmith will still store tokens for search in ClickHouse. If you are using LangSmith Managed Clickhouse, you may want to disable this feature to avoid sending potentially sensitive information to ClickHouse. You can do this in your blob storage configuration.\\n\\u200bConfiguration\\nAfter creating your bucket and obtaining the necessary credentials, you can configure LangSmith to use your blob storage system.\\nHelmDockerCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    enabled: true\\n    engine: \"S3\" # Or \"Azure\". This is case-sensitive.\\n    chSearchEnabled: true # Set to false if you want to disable CH search (Recommended for LangSmith Managed Clickhouse)\\n    bucketName: \"your-bucket-name\"\\n    apiURL: \"Your connection url\"\\n    accessKey: \"Your access key\" # Optional.

This is recommended over providing the access key and secret key directly in your config. See the generated secret template for the expected secret keys.\\n\\u200bTTL Configuration\\nIf using the TTL feature with LangSmith, you’ll also have to configure TTL rules for your blob storage. Trace information stored on blob storage is stored on a particular prefix path, which determines the TTL for the data. When a trace’s retention is extended, its corresponding blob storage path changes to ensure that it matches the new extended retention.\\nThe following TTL prefix are used:\\n\\nttl_s/: Short term TTL, configured for 14 days.\\nttl_l/: Long term TTL, configured for 400 days.\\n\\nIf you have customized the TTLs in your LangSmith configuration, you will need to adjust the TTLs in your blob storage configuration to match.\\n\\u200bAmazon S3\\nIf using S3 for your blob storage, you will need to setup a filter lifecycle configuration that matches the prefixes above. You can find information for this in the Amazon Documentation.\\nAs an example, if you are using Terraform to manage your S3 bucket, you would setup something like this:\\nCopy  rule {\\n    id      = \"short-term-ttl\"\\n    prefix  = \"ttl_s/\"\\n    enabled = true\\n    expiration {\\n      days = 14\\n    }\\n  }\\n  rule {\\n    id      = \"long-term-ttl\"\\n    prefix  = \"ttl_l/\"\\n    enabled = true\\n    expiration {\\n      days = 400\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n\\u200bGoogle Cloud Storage\\nYou will need to setup lifecycle conditions for your GCS buckets that you are using. You can find information for this in the Google Documentation, specifically using matchesPrefix.\\nAs an example, if you are using Terraform to manage your GCS bucket, you would setup something like this:\\nCopy  lifecycle_rule {\\n    condition {\\n      age            = 14\\n      matches_prefix = [\"ttl_s\"]\\n    }\\n    action {\\n      type = \"Delete\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n  lifecycle_rule {\\n    condition {\\n      age            = 400\\n      matches_prefix = [\"ttl_l\"]\\n    }\\n    action {\\n      type = \"Delete\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n\\u200bAzure blob storage\\nYou will need to configure a lifecycle management policy on the container in order to expire objects matching the prefixes above.\\nAs an example, if you are using Terraform to manage your blob storage container, you would setup something like this:\\nCopyresource \"azurerm_storage_management_policy\" \"example\" {\\n  storage_account_id = \"my-storage-account-id\"\\n  rule {\\n    name = \"base\"\\n    enabled = true\\n    type = \"Lifecycle\"\\n    filters {\\n      prefix_match = [\"my-container/ttl_s\"]\\n      blob_types = [\"blockBlob\"]\\n    }\\n    actions {\\n      base_blob {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 14\\n      }\\n      snapshot {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 14\\n      }\\n      version {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 14\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  rule {\\n    name = \"extended\"\\n    enabled = true\\n    type = \"Lifecycle\"\\n    filters {\\n      prefix_match = [\"my-container/ttl_l\"]\\n      blob_types = [\"blockBlob\"]\\n    }\\n    actions {\\n      base_blob {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 400\\n      }\\n      snapshot {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 400\\n      }\\n      version {\\n        delete_after_days_since_creation_greater_than = 400\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsUse an existing secret for your installation (Kubernetes)Connect to an external ClickHouse database⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

This is required when connecting securely to model providers or external services, especially if you rely on self-signed certificates or internal certificate authorities. This page describes two related tasks:\\n\\nUsing custom TLS certificates for model providers (such as Azure, OpenAI, or a custom model server)\\nMounting internal certificate authorities (CAs) to enable TLS connections for databases and other external services.\\n\\n\\u200bUse custom TLS certificates for model providers\\nThis feature is currently only available for the following model providers:\\nAzure OpenAI\\nOpenAI\\nCustom (our custom model server). Refer to the custom model server documentation for more information.\\nThese TLS settings will apply to all invocations of the selected model providers including when used through Online Evaluation.\\nYou can use custom TLS certificates to connect to model providers in the LangSmith playground. This is useful if you are using a self-signed certificate, a certificate from a custom certificate authority or mutual TLS authentication.\\nTo use custom TLS certificates, you need to set the following environment variables. See the self hosted deployment section for more information on how to set up application configuration.\\n\\nLANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_MODEL_PROVIDERS: A comma-separated list of model providers that require custom TLS certificates. Note that azure_openai, openai and custom are currently the only supported model provider that supports custom TLS certificates, but more providers will be supported in the future.\\nLANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_CA: The custom certificate authority (CA) certificate in PEM format. This must be a file path (for a mounted volume).\\n[Optional] LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_KEY: The private key in PEM format. This must be a file path (for a mounted volume). This is usually only necessary for mutual TLS authentication.\\n[Optional] LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_CERT: The certificate in PEM format. This must be a file path (for a mounted volume). This is usually only necessary for mutual TLS authentication.\\n\\nOnce you have set these environment variables, enter the LangSmith Playground Settings page and select the Provider that requires custom TLS certificates. Set your model provider configuration as usual, and the custom TLS certificates will be used when connecting to the model provider.\\n\\u200bMount internal CAs for TLS\\n\\nCreate a file containing all CAs required for TLS with databases and external services. If your deployment is communicating directly to beacon.langchain.com without a proxy, make sure to include a public trusted CA.

It allows for fast ingestion of data and is optimized for analytical queries.\\nLangSmith uses ClickHouse as the primary data store for traces and feedback. By default, self-hosted LangSmith will use an internal ClickHouse database that is bundled with the LangSmith instance. This is run as a stateful set in the same Kubernetes cluster as the LangSmith application or as a Docker container on the same host as the LangSmith application.\\nHowever, you can configure LangSmith to use an external ClickHouse database for easier management and scaling. By configuring an external ClickHouse database, you can manage backups, scaling, and other operational tasks for your database. While Clickhouse is not yet a native service in Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud, you can run LangSmith with an external ClickHouse database in the following ways:\\n\\n\\nLangSmith-managed ClickHouse\\n\\n\\nProvision a ClickHouse Cloud either directly or through a cloud provider marketplace:\\n\\nAzure Marketplace\\nGoogle Cloud Marketplace\\nAWS Marketplace\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a VM in your cloud provider\\n\\n\\nUsing the first two options (LangSmith-managed ClickHouse or ClickHouse Cloud) will provision a Clickhouse service OUTSIDE of your VPC. However, both options support private endpoints, meaning that you can direct traffic to the ClickHouse service without exposing it to the public internet (eg via AWS PrivateLink, or GCP Private Service Connect).Additionally, sensitive information can be configured to be not stored in Clickhouse. Please reach out to support@langchain.dev for more information.\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\nA provisioned ClickHouse instance that your LangSmith application will have network access to (see above for options).\\nA user with admin access to the ClickHouse database. This user will be used to create the necessary tables, indexes, and views.\\nWe support both standalone ClickHouse and externally managed clustered deployments. For clustered deployments, ensure all nodes are running the same version. Note that clustered setups are not supported with bundled ClickHouse installations.\\nWe only support ClickHouse versions >= 23.9. Use of ClickHouse versions >= 24.2 requires LangSmith v0.6 or later.\\nWe rely on a few configuration parameters to be set on your ClickHouse instance. These are detailed below:\\n\\nCopy<profiles>\\n  <default>\\n      <async_insert>1</async_insert> # Turn on async insert\\n      <async_insert_max_data_size>25000000</async_insert_max_data_size> # Flush data to disk after 25MB. You may need to adjust this based on your workload.\\n      <wait_for_async_insert>0</wait_for_async_insert> # Disable waiting for async insert by default\\n      <parallel_view_processing>1</parallel_view_processing> # Enable parallel view processing\\n      <materialize_ttl_after_modify>0</materialize_ttl_after_modify> # Disable TTL materialization after modify\\n      <wait_for_async_insert_timeout>120</wait_for_async_insert_timeout> # Set the timeout for waiting for async insert\\n      <lightweight_deletes_sync>0</lightweight_deletes_sync> # Disable lightweight deletes sync\\n      <allow_materialized_view_with_bad_select>1</allow_materialized_view_with_bad_select> # Allow materialized views with legacy SELECT statements that cause CH to fail\\n  </default>\\n</profiles>\\n\\nOur system has been tuned to work with the above configuration parameters. Changing these parameters may result in unexpected behavior.\\n\\u200bHA Replicated Clickhouse Cluster\\nBy default, the setup process above will only work with a single node Clickhouse cluster.\\nIf you would like to use a multi-node Clickhouse cluster for HA, we support this with additional required configuration. This setup can use a Clickhouse cluster with multiple nodes where data replicated via Zookeeper or Clickhouse Keeper. For more information on Clickhouse replication, see Clickhouse Data Replication Docs.\\nIn order to setup LangSmith with a replicated multi-node Clickhouse setup:\\n\\nYou need to have a Clickhouse cluster that is setup with Keeper or Zookeeper for data replication and the appropriate settings. See Clickhouse Replication Setup Docs.\\nYou need to set the cluster setting in the LangSmith Configuration section, specifically the cluster settings to match your Clickhouse Cluster name. This will use the Replicated table engines when running the Clickhouse migrations.\\nIf in addition to HA, you would like to load balance among the Clickhouse nodes (to distribute reads or writes), we suggest using a load balancer or DNS load balancing to round robin among your Clickhouse servers.\\nNote: You will need to enable your cluster setting before launching LangSmith for the first time and running the Clickhouse migrations. This is a requirement since the table engine will need to be created as a Replicated table engine vs the non replicated engine type.\\n\\nWhen running migrations with cluster enabled, the migration will create the Replicated table engine flavor. This means that data will be replicated among the servers in the cluster. This is a master-master setup where any server can process reads, writes, or merges.\\nFor an example setup of a replicated ClickHouse cluster, refer to the replicated ClickHouse section in the LangSmith Helm chart repo, under examples.\\n\\u200bLangSmith-managed ClickHouse\\n\\nIf using LangSmith-managed ClickHouse, you will need to set up a VPC peering connection between the LangSmith VPC and the ClickHouse VPC. Please reach out to support@langchain.dev for more information.\\nYou will also need to set up Blob Storage. You can read more about Blob Storage in the Blob Storage documentation.\\n\\nClickHouse installations managed by LangSmith use a SharedMerge engine, which automatically clusters them and separates compute from storage.\\nFor more information, refer to the managed ClickHouse page.\\n\\u200bParameters\\nYou will need to provide several parameters to your LangSmith installation to configure an external ClickHouse database. These parameters include:\\n\\nHost: The hostname or IP address of the ClickHouse database\\nHTTP Port: The port that the ClickHouse database listens on for HTTP connections\\nNative Port: The port that the ClickHouse database listens on for native connections\\nDatabase: The name of the ClickHouse database that LangSmith should use\\nUsername: The username to use to connect to the ClickHouse database\\nPassword: The password to use to connect to the ClickHouse database\\nCluster (Optional): The name of the ClickHouse cluster if using an external Clickhouse cluster. When set, LangSmith will run migrations on the cluster and replicate data across instances.\\n\\nImportant considerations for clustered deployments:\\n\\nClustered setups must be configured on a fresh schema - existing standalone ClickHouse instances cannot be converted to clustered mode.\\n\\n\\nClustering is only supported with externally managed ClickHouse deployments. It is not compatible with bundled ClickHouse installations as these do not include required ZooKeeper configurations.\\n\\n\\nWhen using a clustered deployment, LangSmith will automatically:\\n\\n\\nRun database migrations across all nodes in the cluster\\n\\n\\nConfigure tables for data replication across the cluster\\n\\nNote that while data is replicated across nodes, LangSmith does not configure distributed tables or handle query routing - queries will be directed to the specified host. You will need to handle any load balancing or query distribution at the infrastructure level if desired.\\n\\u200bConfiguration\\nWith these parameters in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use the provisioned ClickHouse database. You can do this by modifying the config.yaml file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the .env file for your Docker installation.\\nHelmDockerCopyclickhouse:\\n  external:\\n    enabled: true\\n    host: \"host\"\\n    port: \"http port\"\\n    nativePort: \"native port\"\\n    user: \"default\"\\n    password: \"password\"\\n    database: \"default\"\\n    tls: false\\n    cluster: \"my_cluster_name\"  # Optional: Set this if using an external Clickhouse cluster\\n\\nOnce configured, you should be able to reinstall your LangSmith instance.

Depending on your cloud provider, this may result in a public IP address being assigned to the service. If you would like to use a custom domain or have more control over the routing of traffic to your LangSmith installation, you can configure an Ingress.\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\nAn existing Kubernetes cluster\\nAn existing Ingress Controller installed in your Kubernetes cluster\\n\\n\\u200bParameters\\nYou may need to provide certain parameters to your LangSmith installation to configure the Ingress. Additionally, we will want to convert the langsmith-frontend service to a ClusterIP service.\\n\\n\\nHostname (optional): The hostname that you would like to use for your LangSmith installation. E.g \"langsmith.example.com\". If you leave this empty, the ingress will serve all traffic to the LangSmith installation.\\n\\n\\nSubdomain (optional): If you would like to serve LangSmith under a URL path, you can specify it here. For example, adding \"langsmith\" will serve the application at \"example.hostname.com/langsmith\". This will apply to UI paths as well as API endpoints.\\n\\n\\nIngressClassName (optional): The name of the Ingress class that you would like to use. If not set, the default Ingress class will be used.\\n\\n\\nAnnotations (optional): Additional annotations to add to the Ingress. Certain providers like AWS may use annotations to control things like TLS termination.\\nFor example, you can add the following annotations using the AWS ALB Ingress Controller to attach an ACM certificate to the Ingress:\\nCopyannotations:\\n  alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: \"<your-certificate-arn>\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLabels (optional): Additional labels to add to the Ingress.\\n\\n\\nTLS (optional): If you would like to serve LangSmith over HTTPS, you can add TLS configuration here (many Ingress controllers may have other ways of controlling TLS so this is often not needed). This should be an array of TLS configurations. Each TLS configuration should have the following fields:\\n\\n\\nhosts: An array of hosts that the certificate should be valid for. E.g [“langsmith.example.com”]\\n\\n\\nsecretName: The name of the Kubernetes secret that contains the certificate and private key. This secret should have the following keys:\\n\\ntls.crt: The certificate\\ntls.key: The private key\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can read more about creating a TLS secret here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bConfiguration\\nWith these parameters in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use an Ingress. You can do this by modifying the config.yaml file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation.\\nCopyingress:\\n  enabled: true\\n  hostname: \"\" # Main domain for LangSmith\\n  subdomain: \"\" # If you want to serve langsmith on a subdomain\\n  ingressClassName: \"\" # If not set, the default ingress class will be used\\n  annotations: {} # Add annotations here if needed\\n  labels: {} # Add labels here if needed\\n  tls: [] # Add TLS configuration here if needed\\nfrontend:\\n  service:\\n    type: ClusterIP\\n\\nOnce configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be accessible via the Ingress. You can run the following to check the status of your Ingress:\\nCopykubectl get ingress\\n\\nYou should see something like this in the output:\\nCopyNAME                         CLASS   HOSTS    ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE\\nlangsmith-ingress            nginx   <host>   35.227.243.203   80, 443   95d\\n\\nIf you do not have automated DNS setup, you will need to add the IP address to your DNS provider manually.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsEnable TTL & data retentionMirror images for your installation⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

However, if you are running LangSmith in an environment that does not have internet access, or if you would like to use a private Docker registry, you can mirror the images to your own registry and then configure your LangSmith installation to use those images.\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\nAuthenticated access to a Docker registry that your Kubernetes cluster/machine has access to.\\nDocker installed on your local machine or a machine that has access to the Docker registry.\\nA Kubernetes cluster or a machine where you can run LangSmith.\\n\\n\\u200bMirroring the Images\\nFor your convenience, we have provided a script that will mirror the images for you. You can find the script in the LangSmith Helm Chart repository\\nTo use the script, you will need to run the script with the following command specifying your registry and platform:\\nCopybash mirror_images.sh <your-registry> [<platform>]\\n\\nWhere <your-registry> is the URL of your Docker registry (e.g. myregistry.com) and <platform> is the platform you are using (e.g. linux/amd64, linux/arm64, etc.). If you do not specify a platform, it will default to linux/amd64.\\nFor example, if your registry is myregistry.com, your platform is linux/arm64, and you want to use the latest version of the images, you would run:\\nCopybash mirror_langsmith_images.sh --registry myregistry --platform linux/arm64 --version 0.10.66\\n\\nNote that this script will assume that you have Docker installed and that you are authenticated to your registry. It will also push the images to the specified registry with the same repository/tag as the original images.\\nAlternatively, you can pull, mirror, and push the images manually. The images that you will need to mirror are found in the values.yaml file of the LangSmith Helm Chart. These can be found here: LangSmith Helm Chart values.yaml\\nHere is an example of how to mirror the images using Docker:\\nCopy# Pull the images from the public registry\\ndocker pull langchain/langsmith-backend:latest\\ndocker tag langchain/langsmith-backend:latest <your-registry>/langsmith-backend:latest\\ndocker push <your-registry>/langsmith-backend:latest\\n\\nYou will need to repeat this for each image that you want to mirror.\\n\\u200bConfiguration\\nOnce the images are mirrored, you will need to configure your LangSmith installation to use the mirrored images. You can do this by modifying the values.yaml file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the .env file for your Docker installation. Replace tag with the version you want to use, e.g. 0.10.66 for the latest version at the time of writing.\\nHelmDockerCopyimages:\\n  imagePullSecrets: [] # Add your image pull secrets here if needed\\n  registry: \"\" # Set this to your registry URL if you mirrored all images to the same registry using our script.

The default configuration for the self-hosted deployment can handle substantial load, and you can configure your deployment to be able to achieve higher scale. This page describes scaling considerations and provides some examples to help configure your self-hosted instance.\\nFor example configurations, refer to Example LangSmith configurations for scale.\\n\\u200bSummary\\nThe table below provides an overview comparing different LangSmith configurations for various load patterns (reads / writes):\\nLow / lowLow / highHigh / lowMedium / mediumHigh / highConcurrent frontend users55502050Traces submitted per second101000101001000Frontend replicas1 (default)4224Platform backend replicas3 (default)203 (default)3 (default)20Queue replicas3 (default)160610160Backend replicas2 (default)5401650Redis resources8 Gi (default)200 Gi external8 Gi (default)13Gi external200 Gi externalClickHouse resources4 CPU16 Gi (default)10 CPU32Gi memory8 CPU16 Gi per replica16 CPU24Gi memory14 CPU24 Gi per replicaClickHouse setupSingle instanceSingle instance3-node replicated clusterSingle instance3-node replicated clusterPostgres resources2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)2 CPU8 GB memory10GB storage (external)Blob storageDisabledEnabledEnabledEnabledEnabled\\nBelow we go into more details about the read and write paths as well as provide a values.yaml snippet for you to start with for your self-hosted LangSmith instance.\\n\\u200bTrace ingestion (write path)\\nCommon usage that put load on the write path:\\n\\nIngesting traces via the Python or JavaScript LangSmith SDK\\nIngesting traces via the @traceable wrapper\\nSubmitting traces via the /runs/multipart endpoint\\n\\nServices that play a large role in trace ingestion:\\n\\nPlatform backend service: Receives initial request to ingest traces and places traces on a Redis queue\\nRedis cache: Used to queue traces that need to be persisted\\nQueue service: Persists traces for querying\\nClickHouse: Persistent storage used for traces\\n\\nWhen scaling up the write path (trace ingestion), it is helpful to monitor the four services/resources listed above. Here are some typical changes that can help increase performance of trace ingestion:\\n\\nGive ClickHouse more resources (CPU and memory) if it is approaching resource limits.\\nIncrease the number of platform-backend pods if ingest requests are taking long to respond.\\nIncrease queue service pod replicas if traces are not being processed from Redis fast enough.\\nUse a larger Redis cache if you notice that the current Redis instance is reaching resource limits. This could also be a reason why ingest requests take a long time.\\n\\n\\u200bTrace querying (read path)\\nCommon usage that puts load on the read path:\\n\\nUsers on the frontend looking at tracing projects or individual traces\\nScripts used to query for trace info\\nHitting either the /runs/query or /runs/<run-id> api endpoints\\n\\nServices that play a large role in querying traces:\\n\\nBackend service: Receives the request and submits a query to ClickHouse to then respond to the request\\nClickHouse: Persistent storage for traces. This is the main database that is queried when requesting trace info.\\n\\nWhen scaling up the read path (trace querying), it is helpful to monitor the two services/resources listed above. Here are some typical changes that can help improve performance of trace querying:\\n\\nIncrease the number of backend service pods. This would be most impactful if backend service pods are reaching 1 core CPU usage.\\nGive ClickHouse more resources (CPU or Memory). ClickHouse can be very resource intensive, but it should lead to better performance.\\nMove to a replicated ClickHouse cluster. Adding replicas of ClickHouse helps with read performance, but we recommend staying below 5 replicas (start with 3).\\n\\nFor more precise guidance on how this translates to helm chart values, refer to the examples the following section. If you are unsure why your LangSmith instance cannot handle a certain load pattern, contact the LangChain team.\\n\\u200bExample LangSmith configurations for scale\\nBelow we provide some example LangSmith configurations based on expected read and write loads.\\nFor read load (trace querying):\\n\\nLow means roughly 5 users looking at traces at a time (about 10 requests per second)\\nMedium means roughly 20 users looking at traces at a time (about 40 requests per second)\\nHigh means roughly 50 users looking at traces at a time (about 100 requests per second)\\n\\nFor write load (trace ingestion):\\n\\nLow means up to 10 traces submitted per second\\nMedium means up to 100 traces submitted per second\\nHigh means up to 1000 traces submitted per second\\n\\nThe exact optimal configuration depends on your usage and trace payloads. Use the examples below in combination with the information above and your specific usage to update your LangSmith configuration as you see fit. If you have any questions, please reach out to the LangChain team.\\n\\u200bLow reads, low writes \\nThe default LangSmith configuration will handle this load. No custom resource configuration is needed here.\\n\\u200bLow reads, high writes \\nYou have a very high scale of trace ingestions, but single digit number of users on the frontend querying traces at any one time.\\nFor this, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage. See configuration section.\\n    enabled: true\\n  settings:\\n    redisRunsExpirySeconds: \"3600\"\\n# ttl:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   ttl_period_seconds:\\n#     longlived: \"7776000\"  # 90 days (default is 400 days)\\n#     shortlived: \"604800\"  # 7 days (default is 14 days)\\n\\nfrontend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 4 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 4\\n#   minReplicas: 2\\n\\nplatformBackend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 20 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 20\\n#   minReplicas: 8\\n\\n## Note that we are actively working on improving performance of this service to reduce the number of replicas.\\nqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 160 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 160\\n#   minReplicas: 40\\n\\nbackend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 5 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 5\\n#   minReplicas: 3\\n\\n## Ensure your Redis cache is at least 200 GB\\nredis:\\n  external:\\n    enabled: true\\n    existingSecretName: langsmith-redis-secret # Set the connection url for your external Redis instance (200+ GB)\\n\\nclickhouse:\\n  statefulSet:\\n    persistence:\\n      # This may depend on your configured TTL (see config section).\\n      # We recommend 600Gi for every shortlived TTL day if operating at this scale constantly.\\n      size: 4200Gi # This assumes 7 days TTL and operating a this scale constantly.\\n    resources:\\n      requests:\\n        cpu: \"10\"\\n        memory: \"32Gi\"\\n      limits:\\n        cpu: \"16\"\\n        memory: \"48Gi\"\\n\\ncommonEnv:\\n  - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_ASYNC_INSERT_WAIT_PCT_FLOAT\"\\n    value: \"0\"\\n\\n\\u200bHigh reads, low writes \\nYou have a relatively low scale of trace ingestions, but many frontend users querying traces and/or have scripts that hit the /runs/query or /runs/<run-id> endpoints frequently.\\nFor this, we strongly recommend setting up a replicated ClickHouse cluster to enable high read scale at low latency. See our external ClickHouse doc for more guidance on how to setup a replicated ClickHouse cluster. For this load pattern, we recommend using a 3 node replicated setup, where each replica in the cluster should have resource requests of 8+ cores and 16+ GB memory, and resource limit of 12 cores and 32 GB memory.\\nFor this, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage.

In internal testing, this configuration allowed us to scale to 100 traces ingested per second and 40 read requests per second.\\nFor this, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage.

See our external ClickHouse doc for more guidance on how to set up a replicated ClickHouse cluster. For this load pattern, we recommend using a 3 node replicated setup, where each replica in the cluster should have resource requests of 14+ cores and 24+ GB memory, and resource limit of 20 cores and 48 GB memory. We also recommend that each node/instance of ClickHouse has 600 Gi of volume storage for each day of TTL that you enable (as per the configuration below).\\nOverall, we recommend a configuration like this:\\nCopyconfig:\\n  blobStorage:\\n    # Please also set the other keys to connect to your blob storage. See configuration section.\\n    enabled: true\\n  settings:\\n    redisRunsExpirySeconds: \"3600\"\\n# ttl:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   ttl_period_seconds:\\n#     longlived: \"7776000\"  # 90 days (default is 400 days)\\n#     shortlived: \"604800\"  # 7 days (default is 14 days)\\n\\nfrontend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 4 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 4\\n#   minReplicas: 2\\n\\nplatformBackend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 20 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 20\\n#   minReplicas: 8\\n\\n## Note that we are actively working on improving performance of this service to reduce the number of replicas.\\nqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 160 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 160\\n#   minReplicas: 40\\n\\nbackend:\\n  deployment:\\n    replicas: 50 # OR enable autoscaling to this level (example below)\\n# autoscaling:\\n#   enabled: true\\n#   maxReplicas: 50\\n#   minReplicas: 20\\n\\n## Ensure your Redis cache is at least 200 GB\\nredis:\\n  external:\\n    enabled: true\\n    existingSecretName: langsmith-redis-secret # Set the connection url for your external Redis instance (200+ GB)\\n\\n# We strongly recommend setting up a replicated clickhouse cluster for this load.\\n# Update these values as needed to connect to your replicated clickhouse cluster.\\nclickhouse:\\n  external:\\n    # If using a 3 node replicated setup, each replica in the cluster should have resource requests of 14+ cores and 24+ GB memory, and resource limit of 20 cores and 48 GB memory.\\n    enabled: true\\n    host: langsmith-ch-clickhouse-replicated.default.svc.cluster.local\\n    port: \"8123\"\\n    nativePort: \"9000\"\\n    user: \"default\"\\n    password: \"password\"\\n    database: \"default\"\\n    cluster: \"replicated\"\\n\\ncommonEnv:\\n  - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_ASYNC_INSERT_WAIT_PCT_FLOAT\"\\n    value: \"0\"\\n\\nEnsure that the Kubernetes cluster is configured with sufficient resources to scale to the recommended size. After deployment, all of the pods in the Kubernetes cluster should be in a Running state. Pods stuck in Pending may indicate that you are reaching node pool limits or need larger nodes.Also, ensure that any ingress controller deployed on the cluster is able to handle the desired load to prevent bottlenecks.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsLangSmith-managed ClickHouseEnable TTL & data retention⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

We also do not support moving from OAuth Mode with client secret to OAuth mode without a client secret and vice versa. Finally, we do not support having both basic auth and OAuth at the same time. Ensure you disable the basic auth configuration when enabling OAuth.\\n\\u200bWith Client Secret (Recommended)\\nBy default, LangSmith Self-Hosted supports the Authorization Code flow with Client Secret. In this version of the flow, your client secret is stored security in the LangSmith platform (not on the frontend) and used for authentication and establishing auth sessions.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nYou must be self-hosted and on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour IdP must support the Authorization Code flow with Client Secret.\\nYour IdP must support using an external discovery/issuer URL. We will use this to fetch the necessary routes and keys for your IdP.\\nYou must provide the OIDC, email, and profile scopes to LangSmith. We use these to fetch the necessary user information and email for your users.\\n\\nLangSmith SSO is only supported over https.\\n\\u200bConfiguration\\n\\nYou will need to set the callback URL in your IdP to https://<host>/api/v1/oauth/custom-oidc/callback, where host is the domain or IP you have provisioned for your LangSmith instance. This is where your IdP will redirect the user after they have authenticated.\\nYou will need to provide the oauthClientId, oauthClientSecret, hostname, and oauthIssuerUrl in your values.yaml file. This is where you will configure your LangSmith instance.\\nIf you have not already configured Oauth with client secret or if you only have personal orgs, you must provide an email address to assign as the initial org admin for the newly provisioned SSO org. If you are upgrading from basic auth, your existing org will be reused instead.\\n\\nHelmDockerCopyconfig:\\n  authType: mixed\\n  hostname: https://langsmith.example.com\\n  initialOrgAdminEmail: test@email.com # Set this if required\\n  oauth:\\n    enabled: true\\n    oauthClientId: <YOUR CLIENT ID>\\n    oauthClientSecret: <YOUR CLIENT SECRET>\\n    oauthIssuerUrl: <YOUR DISCOVERY URL>\\n    oauthScopes: \"email,profile,openid\"\\n\\n\\u200bSession length controls\\nAll of the environment variables in this section are for the platform-backend service and can be added using platformBackend.deployment.extraEnv in Helm.\\n\\nBy default, session length is controlled by the expiration of the identity token returned by the identity provider\\nMost setups should use refresh tokens to enable session length extension beyond the identity token expiration up to OAUTH_SESSION_MAX_SEC, which may require including the offline_access scope by adding to oauthScopes (Helm) or OAUTH_SCOPES (Docker)\\nOAUTH_SESSION_MAX_SEC (default 1 day) can be overridden to a maximum of one week (604800)\\nFor identity provider setups that don’t support refresh tokens, setting OAUTH_OVERRIDE_TOKEN_EXPIRY=\"true\" will take OAUTH_SESSION_MAX_SEC as the session length, ignoring the identity token expiration\\n\\n\\u200bOverride Sub Claim\\nIn some scenarios, it may be necessary to override which claim is used as the sub claim from your identity provider.\\nFor example, in SCIM, the resolved sub claim and SCIM externalId must match in order for login to succeed.\\nIf there are restrictions on the source attribute of the sub claim and/or the SCIM externalId, set the ISSUER_SUB_CLAIM_OVERRIDES environment variable to select which OIDC JWT claim is used as the sub.\\nIf an issuer URL starts with one of the URLs in this configuration, the sub claim is taken from the field name specified.\\nFor example, with the following configuration, a token with the issuer https://idp.yourdomain.com/application/uuid would use the customClaim value as the sub:\\nCopyISSUER_SUB_CLAIM_OVERRIDES=\\'{\"https://idp.yourdomain.com\": \"customClaim\"}\\'\\n\\nIf unset, the default value for this configuration uses the oid claim when Azure Entra ID is used as the identity provider:\\nCopyISSUER_SUB_CLAIM_OVERRIDES=\\'{\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/\": \"oid\", \"https://sts.windows.net/\": \"oid\"}\\'\\n\\n\\u200bGoogle Workspace IdP setup\\nYou can use Google Workspace as a single sign-on (SSO) provider using OAuth2.0 and OIDC without PKCE.\\nYou must have administrator-level access to your organization’s Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to create a new project, or permissions to create and configure OAuth 2.0 credentials for an existing project. We recommend that you create a new project for managing access, since each GCP project has a single OAuth consent screen.\\n\\n\\nCreate a new GCP project, see the Google documentation topic creating and managing projects\\n\\n\\nAfter you have created the project, open the Credentials page in the Google API Console (making sure the project in the top left corner is correct)\\n\\n\\nCreate new credentials: Create Credentials → OAuth client ID\\n\\n\\nChoose Web application as the Application type and enter a name for the application e.g. LangSmith\\n\\n\\nIn Authorized Javascript origins put the domain of your LangSmith instance e.g. https://langsmith.yourdomain.com\\n\\n\\nIn Authorized redirect URIs put the domain of your LangSmith instance followed by /api/v1/oauth/custom-oidc/callback e.g. https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/api/v1/oauth/custom-oidc/callback\\n\\n\\nClick Create, then download the JSON or copy and save the Client ID (ends with .apps.googleusercontent.com) and Client secret somewhere secure. You will be able to access these later if needed.\\n\\n\\nSelect OAuth consent screen from the navigation menu on the left\\n\\nChoose the Application type as Internal. If you select Public, anyone with a Google account can sign in.\\nEnter a descriptive Application name. This name is shown to users on the consent screen when they sign in. For example, use LangSmith or <organization_name> SSO for LangSmith.\\nVerify that the Scopes for Google APIs only lists email, profile, and openid scopes. Only these scopes are required for single sign-on. If you grant additional scopes it increases the risk of exposing sensitive data.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Optional) control who within your organization has access to LangSmith: https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/list?tab=configuredApps. See Google’s documentation for additional details.\\n\\n\\nConfigure LangSmith to use this OAuth application. For examples, here are the configvalues that would be used for Kubernetes configuration:\\n\\noauthClientId: Client ID (ends with .apps.googleusercontent.com)\\noauthClientSecret: Client secret\\nhostname: the domain of your LangSmith instance e.g. https://langsmith.yourdomain.com (no trailing slash)\\noauthIssuerUrl: https://accounts.google.com\\noauth.enabled: true\\nauthType: mixed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bOkta IdP setup\\n\\u200bSupported features\\n\\nIdP-initiated SSO\\nSP-initiated SSO\\n\\n\\u200bConfiguration steps\\nFor additional information, see Okta’s documentation.\\nIf you have any questions or issues, please reach out to support@langchain.dev.\\nVia Okta Integration Network (recommended)\\nThis method of configuration is required in order to use SCIM with Okta.\\n\\nSign in to Okta.\\nIn the upper-right corner, select Admin.

However, if your IdP does not support this, you can use the Authorization Code with PKCE flow.\\nThis flow does not require a Client Secret. For the alternative workflow, refer to With client secret.\\n\\u200bRequirements\\nThere are a couple of requirements for using OAuth SSO with LangSmith:\\n\\nYour IdP must support the Authorization Code with PKCE flow (Google does not support this flow for example, but see above for an alternative configuration that Google supports). This is often displayed in your OAuth Provider as configuring a “Single Page Application (SPA)”\\nYour IdP must support using an external discovery/issuer URL.

This can be useful if you’re complying with data privacy regulations, or if you want to have more efficient space usage and auto cleanup of your traces. Traces will also have their data retention period automatically extended based on certain actions or run rule applications.\\n\\u200bRequirements\\nYou can configure retention through helm or environment variable settings. There are a few options that are configurable:\\n\\nEnabled: Whether data retention is enabled or disabled. If enabled, via the UI you can your default organization and project TTL tiers to apply to traces (see data retention guide for details).\\nRetention Periods: You can configure system-wide retention periods for shortlived and longlived traces. Once configured, you can manage the retention level at each project as well as set an organization-wide default for new projects.\\n\\nHelmDockerCopyconfig:\\n  ttl:\\n    enabled: true\\n    ttl_period_seconds:\\n      # -- 400 day longlived and 14 day shortlived\\n      longlived: \"34560000\"\\n      shortlived: \"1209600\"\\n\\n\\u200bClickHouse TTL Cleanup Job\\nAs of version 0.11, a cron job runs on weekends to assist in deleting expired data that may not have been cleaned up by ClickHouse’s built-in TTL mechanism.\\nThis job uses potentially long running mutations (ALTER TABLE DELETE), which are expensive operations that can impact ClickHouse’s performance. We recommend running these operations only during off-peak hours (nights and weekends). During testing with 1 concurrent active mutation (default), we did not observe significant CPU, memory, or latency increases.\\n\\u200bDefault Schedule\\nBy default, the cleanup job runs:\\n\\nSaturday: 8pm and 10pm UTC\\nSunday: 12am, 2am, and 4am UTC\\n\\n\\u200bDisabling the Job\\nTo disable the cleanup job entirely:\\nCopyqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    extraEnv:\\n      - name: \"ENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON\"\\n        value: \"false\"\\n\\n\\u200bConfiguring the Schedule\\nYou can customize when the cleanup job runs by modifying the cron expressions:\\nCopyqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    extraEnv:\\n      # UTC: Sunday 12am/2am/4am\\n      - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_MORNING\"\\n        value: \"0 0,2,4 * * 0\"\\n      # UTC: Saturday 8pm/10pm\\n      - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_EVENING\"\\n        value: \"0 20,22 * * 6\"\\n\\nTo run the job on a single cron schedule, set both CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_EVENING and CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_MORNING to the same value. Job locking prevents overlapping executions.\\n\\u200bConfiguring Minimum Expired Rows Per Part\\nThe job goes table by table, scanning parts and deleting data from parts containing a minimum number of expired rows. This threshold balances efficiency and thoroughness:\\n\\nToo low: Job scans entire parts to clear minimal data (inefficient)\\nToo high: Job misses parts with significant expired data\\n\\nCopyqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    extraEnv:\\n      - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MIN_EXPIRED_ROWS_PER_PART\"\\n        value: \"100000\" # 100k expired rows\\n\\n\\u200bChecking Expired Rows\\nUse this query to analyze expired rows in your tables, and tweak your minimum value accordingly:\\nCopy-- Query for Runs table. For other tables, replace \\'ttl_seconds\\' with \\'trace_ttl_seconds\\'\\nSELECT\\n    _part,\\n    count() AS expired_rows\\nFROM runs\\nWHERE trace_first_received_at IS NOT NULL\\nAND ttl_seconds IS NOT NULL\\nAND toDateTime(assumeNotNull(trace_first_received_at) + toIntervalSecond(assumeNotNull(ttl_seconds))) < now()\\nGROUP BY _part\\nORDER BY expired_rows DESC\\n\\n\\u200bConfiguring Maximum Active Mutations\\nDelete operations can be time-consuming (~50 minutes for a 100GB part). You can increase concurrent mutations to speed up the process:\\nCopyqueue:\\n  deployment:\\n    extraEnv:\\n      - name: \"CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MAX_ACTIVE_MUTATIONS\"\\n        value: \"1\"\\n\\nIncreasing concurrent DELETE operations can severely impact system performance. Monitor your system carefully and only increase this value if you can tolerate potentially slower insert and read latencies.\\n\\u200bEmergency: Stopping Running Mutations\\nIf you experience latency spikes and need to terminate a running mutation:\\n\\n\\nFind active mutations:\\nCopySELECT * FROM system.mutations WHERE is_done = 0;\\n\\nLook for the mutation_id where the command column contains a DELETE statement.\\n\\n\\nKill the mutation:\\nCopyKILL MUTATION WHERE mutation_id = \\'<mutation_id>\\';\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bBackups and Data Retention\\nIf disk space does not decrease after running this job, or if it continues to increase, backups may be causing the issue by creating file system hard links. These links prevent ClickHouse from cleaning up the data.\\nTo verify, check the following directories inside your ClickHouse pod:\\n\\n/var/lib/clickhouse/backup\\n/var/lib/clickhouse/shadow\\n\\nIf backups are present, copy them to an external filesystem or blob storage (e.g., S3), then clear the directories. Within a few minutes, you will notice disk space releasing.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsConfigure for scaleCreate an Ingress for installations (Kubernetes)⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you are interested in this feature, contact our sales team. Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\\nYou may find it helpful to read the Administration overview page before setting up access control.\\nLangSmith relies on RBAC to manage user permissions within a workspace. This allows you to control who can access your LangSmith workspace and what they can do within it. Only users with the workspace:manage permission can manage access control settings for a workspace.\\n\\u200bCreate a role\\nBy default, LangSmith comes with a set of system roles:\\n\\nAdmin: has full access to all resources within the workspace.\\nViewer: has read-only access to all resources within the workspace.\\nEditor: has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys).\\n\\nIf these do not fit your access model, Organization Admins can create custom roles to suit your needs.\\nTo create a role, navigate to the Roles tab in the Members and roles section of the Organization settings page. Note that new roles that you create will be usable across all workspaces within your organization.\\nClick on the Create Role button to create a new role. A Create role form will open.\\n\\nAssign permissions for the different LangSmith resources that you want to control access to.\\n\\u200bAssign a role to a user\\nOnce you have your roles set up, you can assign them to users. To assign a role to a user, navigate to the Workspace members tab in the Workspaces section of the Organization settings page\\nEach user will have a Role dropdown that you can use to assign a role to them.\\n\\nYou can also invite new users with a given role.\\n\\n\\u200bSet up SAML SSO for your organization\\nSingle Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise Cloud customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.\\nLangSmith’s SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.\\nSSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session. The benefits of SSO include:\\n\\nStreamlines user management across systems for organization owners.\\nEnables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g., MFA).\\nRemoves the need for end users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies the end-user experience, by allowing sign in at one single access point across multiple applications.\\n\\n\\u200bJust-in-time (JIT) provisioning\\nLangSmith supports Just-in-time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.\\nJIT provisioning only runs for new users, that is, users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a different login method.\\n\\u200bLogin methods and access\\nOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other login methods, such as username/password or Google Authentication”:\\n\\nWhen logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.\\nUsers with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have personal organizations.\\nWhen logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of.\\n\\n\\u200bEnforce SAML SSO only\\nTo ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the Login via SSO only checkbox and click Save. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking Save.\\nYou must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to Only SAML SSO. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs. If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, reach out to the LangChain support team at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nSAML SSO is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Please contact sales to learn more.\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SAML SSO.\\n\\nFor instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning, refer to the SCIM setup.\\n\\u200bInitial configuration\\nFor IdP-specific configuration steps, refer to one of the following:\\nEntra ID\\nGoogle\\nOkta\\n\\n\\n\\nIn your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3.\\nThe following URLs are different for the US and EU regions. Ensure you select the correct link.\\n\\nSingle sign-on URL (or ACS URL):\\n\\nUS: https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs\\nEU: https://eu.auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs\\n\\n\\nAudience URI (or SP Entity ID):\\n\\nUS: https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata\\nEU: https://eu.auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata\\n\\n\\nName ID format: email address.\\nApplication username: email address.\\nRequired claims: sub and email.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn LangSmith: Go to Settings -> Members and roles -> SSO Configuration. Fill in the required information and submit to activate SSO login:\\n\\nFill in either the SAML metadata URL or SAML metadata XML.\\nSelect the Default workspace role and Default workspaces. New users logging in via SSO will be added to the specified workspaces with the selected role.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefault workspace role and Default workspaces are editable.

You can find this in the LangSmith UI under Organization members and roles then SSO configuration.\\n\\u200bSet up SCIM for your organization\\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and de-provision users in your LangSmith organization and workspaces, keeping user access synchronized with your organization’s identity provider.\\nSCIM is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan. Contact sales to learn more.SCIM is available on Helm chart versions 0.10.41 (application version 0.10.108) and later.SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).\\nSCIM eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization’s identity system. This allows for:\\n\\nAutomated user management: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP.\\nReduced administrative overhead: No need to manage user access manually across multiple systems.\\nImproved security: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith.\\nConsistent access control: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems.\\nScaling team access control: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles.\\nRole assignment: Select specific Organization Roles and Workspace Roles for groups of users.\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\nYour organization must be on an Enterprise plan.\\nYour Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0.\\nOnly Organization Admins can configure SCIM.\\nFor cloud customers: SAML SSO must be configurable for your organization.\\nFor self-hosted customers: OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode must be enabled.\\nFor self-hosted customers, network traffic must be allowed from the identity provider to LangSmith:\\n\\nMicrosoft Entra ID supports allowlisting IP ranges or an agent-based solution to provide connectivity.\\n(details).\\nOkta supports allow-listing IPs or domains (details)\\nor an agent-based solution (details) to provide connectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bRole Precedence\\nWhen a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:\\n\\nOrganization Admin groups take highest precedence. Users in these groups will be Admin in all workspaces.\\nMost recently created workspace-specific group takes precedence over other workspace groups.\\n\\nWhen a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules.SCIM group membership will override manually assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.\\n\\u200bEmail verification\\nIn cloud only, creating a new user with SCIM triggers an email to the user.\\nThey must verify their email address by clicking the link in this email.\\nThe link expires in 24 hours, and can be resent if needed by removing and re-adding the user via SCIM.\\n\\u200bAttributes and Mapping\\n\\u200bGroup Naming Convention\\nGroup membership maps to LangSmith workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:\\nOrganization Admin Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix>Organization Admin or <optional_prefix>Organization Admins\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization Admins\\nGroups-Organization Admins\\nOrganization Admin\\n\\nWorkspace-Specific Groups\\nFormat: <optional_prefix><org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>\\nExamples:\\n\\nLS:Organization User:Production:Annotators\\nGroups-Organization User:Engineering:Developers\\nOrganization User:Marketing:Viewers\\n\\n\\u200bMapping\\nWhile specific instructions depending on the identity provider may vary, these mappings show what is supported by the LangSmith SCIM integration:\\n\\u200bUser Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserName1email addressactive!deactivatedemails[type eq \"work\"].valueemail address2name.formatteddisplayName OR givenName + familyName3givenNamegivenNamefamilyNamefamilyNameexternalIdsub41\\n\\nuserName is not required by LangSmith\\nEmail address is required\\nUse the computed expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion for cloud customers, or the sub OAuth2.0 claim for self-hosted.\\n\\n\\u200bGroup Attributes\\nLangSmith App AttributeIdentity Provider AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description identity provider attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\n\\u200bStep 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)\\nThere are two scenarios for SAML SSO configuration:\\n\\nIf SAML SSO is already configured for your organization, you should skip the steps to initially add the application (Add application from Okta Integration Network or Create a new Entra ID application integration), as you already have an application configured and just need to enable provisioning.\\nIf you are configuring SAML SSO for the first time alongside SCIM, first follow the instructions to set up SAML SSO, then follow the instructions here to enable SCIM.\\n\\n\\u200bNameID Format\\nLangSmith uses the SAML NameID to identify users. The NameID is a required field in the SAML response and is case-insensitive.\\nThe NameID must:\\n\\nBe unique to each user.\\nBe a persistent value that never changes, such as a randomly generated unique user ID.\\nMatch exactly on each sign-in attempt. It should not rely on user input.\\n\\nThe NameID should not be an email address or username because email addresses and usernames are more likely to change over time and can be case-sensitive.\\nThe NameID format must be Persistent, unless you are using a field, like email, that requires a different format.\\n\\u200bStep 2: Disable JIT provisioning\\nBefore enabling SCIM, disable Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning.\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Cloud\\nUse the PATCH /orgs/current/info endpoint:\\nCopycurl -X PATCH $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/orgs/current/info \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"jit_provisioning_enabled\": false}\\'\\n\\n\\u200bDisabling JIT for Self-Hosted\\nAs of LangSmith chart version 0.11.14, you can disable JIT provisioning for your self-hosted organization using SSO. To disable, set the following values:\\nCopycommonEnv:\\n  - name: SELF_HOSTED_JIT_PROVISIONING_ENABLED\\n    value: \"false\"\\n\\n\\u200bStep 3: Generate SCIM bearer token\\nIn self-hosted environments, the full URL below may look like https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (without a subdomain, note the /api/v1 path prefix) or https://langsmith.yourdomain.com/subdomain/api/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens (with a subdomain) - see the ingress docs for more details.\\nGenerate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests. Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:\\nCopycurl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\" \\\\\\n  -H \"X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID\" \\\\\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n  -d \\'{\"description\": \"Your description here\"}\\'\\n\\nNote that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request. These additional endpoints are present:\\n\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens\\nGET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\nPATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id} (only the description field is supported)\\nDELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}\\n\\n\\u200bStep 4: Configure your Identity Provider\\nIf you use Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) or Okta, there are specific instructions for identity provider setup (refer to Azure Entra ID, Okta). The requirements and steps above are applicable for all identity providers.\\n\\u200bAzure Entra ID configuration steps\\nFor additional information, see Microsoft’s documentation.\\nIn self-hosted installations, the oid JWT claim is used as the sub.\\nSee this Microsoft Learn link\\nand the related configuration instructions for additional details.\\nStep 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application\\n\\nLog in to the Azure portal with a privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator).\\nNavigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nIn the left-side navigation, select Manage > Provisioning.\\nClick Get started.\\n\\nStep 2: Configure Admin credentials\\n\\n\\nUnder Admin Credentials:\\n\\n\\nTenant URL:\\n\\nUS: https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nEU: https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2\\nSelf-hosted: <langsmith_url>/scim/v2\\n\\n\\n\\nSecret Token: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClick Test Connection to verify the configuration.\\n\\n\\nClick Save.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Configure Attribute Mappings\\nConfigure the following attribute mappings under Mappings:\\nUser Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedenceuserNameuserPrincipalNameactiveNot([IsSoftDeleted])emails[type eq \"work\"].valuemail1name.formatteddisplayName OR Join(\" \", [givenName], [surname])2externalIdobjectId31\\n\\nUser’s email address must be present in Entra ID.\\nUse the Join expression if your displayName does not match the format of Firstname Lastname.\\nTo avoid inconsistency, this should match the SAML NameID assertion and the sub OAuth2.0 claim. For SAML SSO in cloud, the Unique User Identifier (Name ID) required claim should be user.objectID and the Name identifier format should be persistent.\\n\\nGroup Attributes\\nSet Target Object Actions to Create and Update only (start with Delete disabled for safety):\\nLangSmith App AttributeMicrosoft Entra ID AttributeMatching PrecedencedisplayNamedisplayName11externalIdobjectIdmembersmembers\\n\\nGroups must follow the naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section.\\nIf your company has a group naming policy, you should instead map from the description Microsoft Entra ID Attribute and\\nset the description based on the Group Naming Convention section.\\n\\nStep 4: Assign Users and Groups\\n\\nUnder Applications > Applications, select your LangSmith Enterprise Application.\\nUnder the Assignments tab, click Assign then either Assign to People or Assign to Groups.\\nMake the desired selection(s), then Assign and Done.\\n\\nStep 5: Enable Provisioning\\n\\nSet Provisioning Status to On under Provisioning.\\nMonitor the initial sync to ensure users and groups are provisioned correctly.\\nOnce verified, enable Delete actions for both User and Group mappings.\\n\\nFor troubleshooting, refer to the SAML SSO FAQs. If you have issues setting up SCIM, reach out to the LangChain support team at support@langchain.dev.\\n\\u200bOkta configuration steps\\nYou must use the Okta Lifecycle Management product.

LangSmith requires SSO to manage users and API keys. You can find more information on setting up SSO in the configuration section.\\n\\n\\u200bHow does load balancing/ingress work?\\n\\nYou will need to expose the frontend container/service to your applications/users. This will handle routing to all downstream services.\\nYou will need to terminate SSL at the ingress level. We recommend using a managed service like AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, or Nginx.\\n\\n\\u200bHow can we authenticate to the application?\\n\\nCurrently, our self-hosted solution supports SSO with OAuth2.0 and OIDC as an authn solution. Note, we do offer a no-auth solution but highly recommend setting up oauth before moving into production.\\n\\nYou can find more information on setting up SSO in the configuration section.\\n\\u200bCan I use external storage services?\\n\\nYou can configure LangSmith to use external versions of all storage services. In a production setting, we strongly recommend using external storage services. Check out the configuration section for more information.\\n\\n\\u200bDoes my application need egress to function properly?\\nOur deployment only needs egress for a few things (most of which can reside within your VPC):\\n\\n\\nFetching images (If mirroring your images, this may not be needed)\\n\\n\\nTalking to any LLM endpoints\\n\\n\\nTalking to any external storage services you may have configured\\n\\n\\nFetching OAuth information\\n\\n\\nSubscription Metrics and Operational Metadata (if not running in offline mode)\\n\\nRequires egress to https://beacon.langchain.com\\nSee Egress for more information\\n\\n\\n\\nYour VPC can set up rules to limit any other access. Note: We require the X-Organization-Id and X-Tenant-Id headers to be allowed to be passed through to the backend service. These are used to determine which organization and workspace (previously called “tenant”) the request is for.\\n\\u200bResource requirements for the application?\\n\\nIn kubernetes, we recommend a minimum helm configuration which can be found in here. For docker, we recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.\\nFor Postgres, we recommend a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.\\nFor Redis, we recommend 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.\\nFor Clickhouse, we recommend 32GB of RAM and 8 CPUs.\\n\\n\\u200bSAML SSO FAQs\\n\\u200bHow do I change a SAML SSO user’s email address?\\nSome identity providers retain the original User ID through an email change while others do not, so we recommend that you follow these steps to avoid duplicate users in LangSmith:\\n\\nRemove the user from the organization (see here)\\nChange their email address in the IdP\\nHave them login to LangSmith again via SAML SSO - this will trigger the usual JIT provisioning flow with their new email address\\n\\n\\u200bHow do I fix “405 method not allowed”?\\nEnsure you’re using the correct ACS URL: https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs\\n\\u200bSCIM FAQs\\n\\u200bCan I use SCIM without SAML SSO?\\n\\nCloud: No, SAML SSO is required for SCIM in cloud deployments\\nSelf-hosted: Yes, SCIM works with OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode\\n\\n\\u200bWhat happens if I have both JIT provisioning and SCIM enabled?\\nJIT provisioning and SCIM can conflict with each other. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning before enabling SCIM to ensure consistent user provisioning behavior.\\n\\u200bHow do I change a user’s role or workspace access?\\nUpdate the user’s group membership in your IdP. The changes will be synchronized to LangSmith according to the role precedence rules.\\n\\u200bWhat happens when a user is removed from all groups?\\nThe user will be deprovisioned from your LangSmith organization according to your IdP’s deprovisioning settings.\\n\\u200bCan I use custom group names?\\nYes. If your identity provider supports syncing alternate fields to the displayName group attribute, you may use an alternate attribute (like description) as the displayName in LangSmith and retain full customizability of the identity provider group name. Otherwise, groups must follow the specific naming convention described in the Group Naming Convention section to properly map to LangSmith roles and workspaces.\\n\\u200bWhy is my Okta integration not working?\\nSee Okta’s troubleshooting guide here: https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-group-push-troubleshoot.htm.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsUser managementCloud architecture and scalability⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

See our pricing page for more detail, and contact our sales team if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.\\nThis guide provides instructions for installing and setting up your environment to run LangSmith locally using Docker. You can do this either by using the LangSmith SDK or by using Docker Compose directly.\\nNote that use of Docker is limited to local development environments only and does not extend support to container services such as AWS Elastic Container Service, Azure Container Instances, and Google Cloud Run.\\nDo not use this in production.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\n\\nEnsure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:\\nCopydocker info\\n\\nIf you don’t see any server information in the output, make sure Docker is installed correctly and launch the Docker daemon.\\n\\nRecommended: At least 4 vCPUs, 16GB Memory available on your machine.\\n\\nYou may need to tune resource requests/limits for all of our different services based off of organization size/usage\\n\\n\\nDisk Space: LangSmith can potentially require a lot of disk space. Ensure you have enough disk space available.\\n\\n\\n\\nLangSmith License Key\\n\\nYou can get this from your LangChain representative. Contact our sales team for more information.\\n\\n\\n\\nApi Key Salt\\n\\nThis is a secret key that you can generate. It should be a random string of characters.\\nYou can generate this using the following command:\\n\\nCopyopenssl rand -base64 32\\n\\n\\n\\nEgress to https://beacon.langchain.com (if not running in offline mode)\\n\\nLangSmith requires egress to https://beacon.langchain.com for license verification and usage reporting. This is required for LangSmith to function properly. You can find more information on egress requirements in the Egress section.\\n\\n\\n\\nConfiguration\\n\\nThere are several configuration options that you can set in the .env file. You can find more information on the available configuration options in the Configuration section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bRunning via Docker Compose\\nThe following explains how to run the LangSmith using Docker Compose. This is the most flexible way to run LangSmith without Kubernetes. The default configuration for Docker Compose is intended for local testing only and not for instances where any services are exposed to the public internet. In production, we highly recommend using a secured Kubernetes environment.\\n\\u200b1. Fetch the LangSmith docker-compose.yml file\\nYou can find the docker-compose.yml file and related files in the LangSmith SDK repository here: LangSmith Docker Compose File\\nCopy the docker-compose.yml file and all files in that directory from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory.\\n\\nEnsure that you copy the users.xml file as well.\\n\\n\\u200b2. Configure environment variables\\n\\nCopy the .env.example file from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory and rename it to .env.\\nConfigure the appropriate values in the .env file. You can find the available configuration options in the Configuration section.\\n\\nYou can also set these environment variables in the docker-compose.yml file directly or export them in your terminal. We recommend setting them in the .env file.\\n\\u200b3. Start server\\nStart the LangSmith application by executing the following command in your terminal:\\nCopydocker-compose up\\n\\nYou can also run the server in the background by running:\\nCopydocker-compose up -d\\n\\n\\u200bValidate your deployment:\\n\\n\\nCurl the exposed port of the cli-langchain-frontend-1 container:\\nCopycurl localhost:1980/info{\"version\":\"0.5.7\",\"license_expiration_time\":\"2033-05-20T20:08:06\",\"batch_ingest_config\":{\"scale_up_qsize_trigger\":1000,\"scale_up_nthreads_limit\":16,\"scale_down_nempty_trigger\":4,\"size_limit\":100,\"size_limit_bytes\":20971520}}\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit the exposed port of the cli-langchain-frontend-1 container on your browser\\nThe LangSmith UI should be visible/operational at http://localhost:1980\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bChecking the logs\\nIf, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run\\nCopydocker-compose logs\\n\\n\\u200bStopping the server\\nCopydocker-compose down\\n\\n\\u200bUsing LangSmith\\nNow that LangSmith is running, you can start using it to trace your code.

See our pricing page for more detail, and contact our sales team if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.\\nThis guide will walk you through the process of deploying LangSmith to a Kubernetes cluster. We will use Helm to install LangSmith and its dependencies.\\nWe’ve successfully tested LangSmith on the following Kubernetes distributions:\\n\\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE)\\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\\nOpenShift (4.14+)\\nMinikube and Kind (for development purposes)\\n\\nWe have several Terraform modules the help in the provisioning of resources for LangSmith. You can find those in our public Terraform repo.Supported cloud providers include:\\nAWS terraform modules\\nAzure terraform modules\\nYou can click on the links above to see the documentation for each module. These modules are designed to help you quickly set up the necessary infrastructure for LangSmith, including Kubernetes clusters, storage, and networking.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\nEnsure you have the following tools/items ready.

By default, these services are installed inside your Kubernetes cluster. However, we highly recommend using external databases instead. For PostgreSQL and Redis, the best option is your cloud provider’s managed services.\\nFor more information, refer to the following setup guides for external services:\\n\\nPostgreSQL\\nRedis\\nClickHouse\\n\\n\\u200bKubernetes cluster requirements\\n\\n\\nYou will need a working Kubernetes cluster that you can access via kubectl. Your cluster should have the following minimum requirements:\\n\\n\\nRecommended: At least 16 vCPUs, 64GB Memory available\\n\\nYou may need to tune resource requests/limits for all of our different services based off of organization size/usage. Our recommendations can be found here.\\nWe recommend using a cluster autoscaler to handle scaling up/down of nodes based on resource usage.\\nWe recommend setting up the metrics server so that autoscaling can be turned on.\\nIf you are running Clickhouse in-cluster, you must have a node with at least 4 vCPUs and 16GB of memory allocatable as ClickHouse will request this amount of resources by default.\\n\\n\\n\\nValid Dynamic PV provisioner or PVs available on your cluster (required only if you are running databases in-cluster)\\n\\nTo enable persistence, we will try to provision volumes for any database running in-cluster.\\nIf using PVs in your cluster, we highly recommend setting up backups in a production environment.\\nWe strongly encourage using a storage class backed by SSDs for better performance. We recommend 7000 IOPS and 1000 MiB/s throughput.\\nOn EKS, you may need to ensure you have the ebs-csi-driver installed and configured for dynamic provisioning. Refer to the EBS CSI Driver documentation for more information.\\n\\nYou can verify this by running:\\nCopykubectl get storageclass\\n\\nThe output should show at least one storage class with a provisioner that supports dynamic provisioning. For example:\\nCopyNAME            PROVISIONER                 RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE\\ngp2 (default)   ebs.csi.eks.amazonaws.com   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   161d\\n\\nWe highly recommend using a storage class that supports volume expansion. This is because traces can potentially require a lot of disk space and your volumes may need to be resized over time.\\nRefer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on storage classes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHelm\\n\\nTo install helm refer to the Helm documentation\\n\\n\\n\\nEgress to https://beacon.langchain.com (if not running in offline mode)\\n\\nLangSmith requires egress to https://beacon.langchain.com for license verification and usage reporting. This is required for LangSmith to function properly. You can find more information on egress requirements in the Egress section.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bConfigure your Helm Charts:\\n\\n\\nCreate a new file called langsmith_config.yaml with the configuration options from the previous step.\\n\\nThere are several configuration options that you can set in the langsmith_config.yaml file. You can find more information on specific configuration options in the Configuration section.\\nIf you are new to Kubernetes or Helm, we’d recommend starting with one of the example configurations in the examples directory of the Helm Chart repository here: LangSmith helm chart examples.\\nYou can see a full list of configuration options in the values.yaml file in the Helm Chart repository here: LangSmith Helm Chart\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a minimum, you will need to set the following configuration options (using basic auth):\\nCopyconfig:\\n  langsmithLicenseKey: \"<your license key>\"\\n  apiKeySalt: \"<your api key salt>\"\\n  authType: mixed\\n  basicAuth:\\n    enabled: true\\n    initialOrgAdminEmail: \"admin@langchain.dev\" # Change this to your admin email address\\n    initialOrgAdminPassword: \"secure-password\" # Must be at least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol\\n    jwtSecret: <your jwt salt> # A random string of characters used to sign JWT tokens for basic auth.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou will also need to specify connection details for any external databases you are using.\\n\\u200bDeploying to Kubernetes:\\n\\n\\nVerify that you can connect to your Kubernetes cluster(note: We highly suggest installing into an empty namespace)\\n\\n\\nRun kubectl get pods\\nOutput should look something like:\\nCopykubectl get pods                                                                                                                                                                     ⎈ langsmith-eks-2vauP7wf 21:07:46No resources found in default namespace.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are using a namespace other than the default namespace, you will need to specify the namespace in the helm and kubectl commands by using the -n <namespace> flag.\\n\\n\\nEnsure you have the LangChain Helm repo added. (skip this step if you are using local charts)\\nCopyhelm repo add langchain https://langchain-ai.github.io/helm/\"langchain\" has been added to your repositories\\n\\n\\n\\nFind the latest version of the chart. You can find the available versions in the Helm Chart repository.\\n\\nWe generally recommend using the latest version.\\nYou can also run helm search repo langchain/langsmith --versions to see the available versions. The output will look something like this:\\n\\nCopylangchain/langsmith     0.10.14         0.10.32         Helm chart to deploy the langsmith application ...\\nlangchain/langsmith     0.10.13         0.10.32         Helm chart to deploy the langsmith application ...\\nlangchain/langsmith     0.10.12         0.10.32         Helm chart to deploy the langsmith application ...\\nlangchain/langsmith     0.10.11         0.10.29         Helm chart to deploy the langsmith application ...\\nlangchain/langsmith     0.10.10         0.10.29         Helm chart to deploy the langsmith application ...\\n\\n\\n\\nRun helm upgrade -i langsmith langchain/langsmith --values langsmith_config.yaml --version <version> -n <namespace> --wait --debug\\n\\nReplace <namespace> with the namespace you want to deploy LangSmith to.\\nReplace <version> with the version of LangSmith you want to install from the previous step. Most users should install the latest version available.\\n\\nOnce the helm install command runs and finishes successfully, you should see output similar to this:\\nCopyNAME: langsmith\\nLAST DEPLOYED: Fri Sep 17 21:08:47 2021\\nNAMESPACE: langsmith\\nSTATUS: deployed\\nREVISION: 1\\nTEST SUITE: None\\n\\nThis may take a few minutes to complete as it will create several Kubernetes resources and run several jobs to initialize the database and other services.\\n\\n\\nRun kubectl get pods Output should now look something like this (note the exact pod names may vary based on the version and configuration you used):\\nCopylangsmith-backend-6ff46c99c4-wz22d       1/1     Running   0          3h2m\\nlangsmith-frontend-6bbb94c5df-8xrlr      1/1     Running   0          3h2m\\nlangsmith-hub-backend-5cc68c888c-vppjj   1/1     Running   0          3h2m\\nlangsmith-playground-6d95fd8dc6-x2d9b    1/1     Running   0          3h2m\\nlangsmith-postgres-0                     1/1     Running   0          9h\\nlangsmith-queue-5898b9d566-tv6q8         1/1     Running   0          3h2m\\nlangsmith-redis-0                        1/1     Running   0          9h\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bValidate your deployment:\\n\\n\\nRun kubectl get services\\nOutput should look something like:\\nCopyNAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE\\nlangsmith-backend       ClusterIP      172.20.140.77    <none>                                                                    1984/TCP       35h\\nlangsmith-frontend      LoadBalancer   172.20.253.251   <external ip>                                                             80:31591/TCP   35h\\nlangsmith-hub-backend   ClusterIP      172.20.112.234   <none>                                                                    1985/TCP       35h\\nlangsmith-playground    ClusterIP      172.20.153.194   <none>                                                                    3001/TCP       9h\\nlangsmith-postgres      ClusterIP      172.20.244.82    <none>                                                                    5432/TCP       35h\\nlangsmith-redis         ClusterIP      172.20.81.217    <none>                                                                    6379/TCP       35h\\n\\n\\n\\nCurl the external ip of the langsmith-frontend service:\\nCopycurl <external ip>/api/tenants\\n\\nExpected output:\\nCopy[{\"id\":\"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\"has_waitlist_access\":true,\"created_at\":\"2023-09-13T18:25:10.488407\",\"display_name\":\"Personal\",\"config\":{\"is_personal\":true,\"max_identities\":1},\"tenant_handle\":\"default\"}]\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit the external ip for the langsmith-frontend service on your browser\\nThe LangSmith UI should be visible/operational\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200bUsing LangSmith\\nNow that LangSmith is running, you can start using it to trace your code.

For easier management and scaling, it is recommended to connect a self-hosted LangSmith instance to an external ClickHouse instance. LangSmith-managed ClickHouse is an option that allows you to use a fully managed ClickHouse instance that is monitored and maintained by the LangSmith team.\\n\\u200bArchitecture Overview\\nThe architecture of using LangSmith-managed ClickHouse with your self-hosted LangSmith instance is similar to using a fully self-hosted ClickHouse instance, with a few key differences:\\n\\nYou will need to set up a private network connection between your LangSmith instance and the LangSmith-managed ClickHouse instance. This is to ensure that your data is secure and that you can connect to the ClickHouse instance from your self-hosted LangSmith instance.\\nWith this option, sensitive information (inputs and outputs) of your traces will be stored in cloud object storage (S3 or GCS) within your cloud instead of ClickHouse to ensure that sensitive information doesn’t leave your VPC. For more details on where particular data fields are stored, refer to Data storage.\\nThe LangSmith team will monitor your ClickHouse instance and ensure that it is running smoothly. This allows us to track metrics like run-ingestion delay and query performance.\\n\\nThe overall architecture looks like this:\\n\\n\\u200bRequirements\\n\\nYou must use a supported blob storage option. Read the blob storage guide for more information.\\nTo use private endpoints, ensure that your VPC is in a ClickHouse Cloud supported region. Otherwise, you will need to use a public endpoint we will secure with firewall rules. Your VPC will need to have a NAT gateway to allow us to allowlist your traffic.\\nYou must have a VPC that can connect to the LangSmith-managed ClickHouse service. You will need to work with our team to set up the necessary networking.\\nYou must have a LangSmith self-hosted instance running. You can use our managed ClickHouse service with both Kubernetes and Docker installations.\\n\\n\\u200bData storage\\nClickHouse stores runs and feedback data, specifically:\\n\\nAll feedback data fields.\\nSome run data fields.\\n\\nFor a list of fields, refer to Stored run data fields and Stored feedback data fields.\\nLangChain defines sensitive application data as inputs, outputs, errors, manifests, extras, and events of a run, since these fields may contain LLM prompts and completions. With LangSmith-managed ClickHouse, these sensitive fields are stored in cloud object storage (S3 or GCS) within your cloud, while the rest of the run data is stored in ClickHouse, ensuring sensitive information never leaves your VPC.\\n\\u200bStored feedback data fields\\nBecause all feedback data is stored in ClickHouse, do not send sensitive information in feedback (scores and annotations/comments) or in any other run fields that are mentioned in Stored run data fields.\\nUsing a LangSmith-managed ClickHouse setup, all feedback data fields are stored in ClickHouse:\\nField NameTypeDescriptionidUUIDUnique identifier for the record itselfcreated_atdatetimeTimestamp when the record was createdmodified_atdatetimeTimestamp when the record was last modifiedsession_idUUIDUnique identifier for the experiment or tracing project the run was a part ofrun_idUUIDUnique identifier for a specific run within a sessionkeystringA key describing the criteria of the feedback, eg “correctness”scorenumberNumerical score associated with the feedback keyvaluestringReserved for storing a value associated with the score.

For example, inputs and outputs content are offloaded to S3/GCS, with the ClickHouse record storing corresponding S3 URLs in the inputs_s3_urls and outputs_s3_urls fields.\\nThe table details each run field and where it is stored:\\nFieldStorage LocationidClickHousenameClickHouseinputsObject Storagerun_typeClickHousestart_timeClickHouseend_timeClickHouseextraObject StorageerrorObject StorageoutputsObject StorageeventsObject StoragetagsClickHousetrace_idClickHousedotted_orderClickHousestatusClickHousechild_run_idsClickHousedirect_child_run_idsClickHouseparent_run_idsClickHousefeedback_statsClickHousereference_example_idClickHousetotal_tokensClickHouseprompt_tokensClickHousecompletion_tokensClickHousetotal_costClickHouseprompt_costClickHousecompletion_costClickHousefirst_token_timeClickHousesession_idClickHousein_datasetClickHouseparent_run_idClickHouseexecution_order (deprecated)ClickHouseserializedClickHousemanifest_id (deprecated)ClickHousemanifest_s3_idClickHouseinputs_s3_urlsClickHouseoutputs_s3_urlsClickHouseprice_model_idClickHouseapp_pathClickHouselast_queued_atClickHouseshare_tokenClickHouse\\nThis reference doc explains the format of stored runs (spans), which are the building blocks of traces.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsView trace counts across an organizationConfigure for scale⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

A DaemonSet can also be used.\\nCopyfilelog:\\n  exclude:\\n    - \"**/otc-container/*.log\"\\n  include:\\n    - /var/log/pods/${POD_NAMESPACE}_${POD_NAME}_${POD_UID}/*/*.log\\n  include_file_name: false\\n  include_file_path: true\\n  operators:\\n    - id: container-parser\\n      type: container\\n  retry_on_failure:\\n    enabled: true\\n  start_at: end\\nenv:\\n  - name: POD_NAME\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.name\\n  - name: POD_NAMESPACE\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.namespace\\n  - name: POD_UID\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.uid\\nvolumes:\\n  - name: varlogpods\\n    hostPath:\\n      path: /var/log/pods\\nvolumeMounts:\\n  - name: varlogpods\\n    mountPath: /var/log/pods\\n    readOnly: true\\n\\nThis configuration requires ‘get’, ‘list’, and ‘watch’ permissions on pods in the given namespace.\\n\\u200bMetrics\\nMetrics can be scraped using the Prometheus endpoints. A single instance Gateway collector can be be used to avoid duplication of queries when fetching metrics. The following config scrapes all of the default named LangSmith services:\\nCopyprometheus:\\n  config:\\n    scrape_configs:\\n      - job_name: langsmith-services\\n        metrics_path: /metrics\\n        scrape_interval: 15s\\n        # Only scrape endpoints in the LangSmith namespace\\n        kubernetes_sd_configs:\\n          - role: endpoints\\n            namespaces:\\n              names: [<langsmith-namespace>]\\n        relabel_configs:\\n          # Only scrape services with the name langsmith-.*\\n          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]\\n            regex: \"langsmith-.*\"\\n            action: keep\\n          # Only scrape ports with the following names\\n          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_name]\\n            regex: \"(backend|platform|playground|redis-metrics|postgres-metrics|metrics)\"\\n            action: keep\\n          # Promote useful metadata into regular labels\\n          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]\\n            target_label: k8s_service\\n          - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]\\n            target_label: k8s_pod\\n          # Replace the default \"host:port\" as Prom\\'s instance label\\n          - source_labels: [__address__]\\n            target_label: instance\\n\\nThis configuration requires ‘get’, ‘list’, and ‘watch’ permissions on pods, services and endpoints in the given namespace.\\n\\u200bTraces\\nFor traces, you need to enable the OTLP receiver. The following configuration can be used to listen to HTTP traces on port 4318, and GRPC on port 4317:\\nCopyotlp:\\n  protocols:\\n    grpc:\\n      endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317\\n    http:\\n      endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318\\n\\n\\u200bProcessors\\n\\u200bRecommended OTEL Processors\\nThe following processors are recommended when using the OTel collector:\\n\\nBatch Processor: Groups the data into batches before sending to exporters.\\nMemory Limiter: Prevents the collector from using too much memory and crashing. When the soft limit is crossed, the collector stops accepting new data.\\nKubernetes Attributes Processor: Adds Kubernetes metadata such as pod name into the telemetry data.\\n\\n\\u200bExporters\\nExporters just need to point to an external endpoint of your liking. The following configuration allows you to configure a separate endpoint for logs, metrics and traces:\\nCopyotlphttp/logs:\\n  endpoint: <your_logs_endpoint>\\notlphttp/metrics:\\n  endpoint: <your_metrics_endpoint>\\notlphttp/traces:\\n  endpoint: <your_traces_endpoint>\\n\\nThe OTel Collector also supports exporting directly to a Datadog endpoint.\\n\\u200bExample Collector Configuration: Logs Sidecar\\nCopymode: sidecar\\nimage: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib\\nconfig:\\n  receivers:\\n    filelog:\\n      exclude:\\n        - \"**/otc-container/*.log\"\\n      include:\\n        - /var/log/pods/${POD_NAMESPACE}_${POD_NAME}_${POD_UID}/*/*.log\\n      include_file_name: false\\n      include_file_path: true\\n      operators:\\n        - id: container-parser\\n          type: container\\n      retry_on_failure:\\n        enabled: true\\n      start_at: end\\n  processors:\\n    batch:\\n      send_batch_size: 8192\\n      timeout: 10s\\n    memory_limiter:\\n      check_interval: 1m\\n      limit_percentage: 90\\n      spike_limit_percentage: 80\\n  exporters:\\n    otlphttp/logs:\\n      endpoint: <your-endpoint>\\n  service:\\n    pipelines:\\n      logs/langsmith:\\n        receivers: [filelog]\\n        processors: [batch, memory_limiter]\\n        exporters: [otlphttp/logs]\\nenv:\\n  - name: POD_NAME\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.name\\n  - name: POD_NAMESPACE\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.namespace\\n  - name: POD_UID\\n    valueFrom:\\n      fieldRef:\\n        fieldPath: metadata.uid\\nvolumes:\\n  - name: varlogpods\\n    hostPath:\\n      path: /var/log/pods\\nvolumeMounts:\\n  - name: varlogpods\\n    mountPath: /var/log/pods\\n    readOnly: true\\n\\n\\u200bExample Collector Configuration: Metrics and Traces Gateway\\nCopymode: deployment\\nimage: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib\\nconfig:\\n  receivers:\\n    prometheus:\\n      config:\\n        scrape_configs:\\n          - job_name: langsmith-services\\n            metrics_path: /metrics\\n            scrape_interval: 15s\\n            # Only scrape endpoints in the LangSmith namespace\\n            kubernetes_sd_configs:\\n              - role: endpoints\\n                namespaces:\\n                  names: [<langsmith-namespace>]\\n            relabel_configs:\\n              # Only scrape services with the name langsmith-.*\\n              - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]\\n                regex: \"langsmith-.*\"\\n                action: keep\\n              # Only scrape ports with the following names\\n              - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_name]\\n                regex: \"(backend|platform|playground|redis-metrics|postgres-metrics|metrics)\"\\n                action: keep\\n              # Promote useful metadata into regular labels\\n              - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]\\n                target_label: k8s_service\\n              - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]\\n                target_label: k8s_pod\\n              # Replace the default \"host:port\" as Prom\\'s instance label\\n              - source_labels: [__address__]\\n                target_label: instance\\n    otlp:\\n      protocols:\\n        grpc:\\n          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317\\n        http:\\n          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318\\n  processors:\\n    batch:\\n      send_batch_size: 8192\\n      timeout: 10s\\n    memory_limiter:\\n      check_interval: 1m\\n      limit_percentage: 90\\n      spike_limit_percentage: 80\\n  exporters:\\n    otlphttp/metrics:\\n      endpoint: <metrics_endpoint>\\n    otlphttp/traces:\\n      endpoint: <traces_endpoint>\\n  service:\\n    pipelines:\\n      metrics/langsmith:\\n        receivers: [prometheus]\\n        processors: [batch, memory_limiter]\\n        exporters: [otlphttp/metrics]\\n      traces/langsmith:\\n        receivers: [otlp]\\n        processors: [batch, memory_limiter]\\n        exporters: [otlphttp/traces]\\nWas this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsExport LangSmith telemetry to your observability backendDeploy an observability stack⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify'),\n",

If you don’t already have an observability stack, or prefer to keep LangSmith telemetry separate from your main application, you can use the LangSmith Observability Helm chart to deploy a basic observability stack.\\n\\u200bSection 1: Prometheus Exporters\\nUse this section if you would like to only deploy metrics exporters for the components in your self hosted deployment, which you can then scrape using your telemetry. If you would like a full observability stack deployed for you, go to the End-to-End Deployment Section.\\nThe helm chart provides a set of Prometheus exporters to expose metrics from Redis, Postgres, Nginx, and Kube state metrics.\\n\\nCreate a local file called langsmith_obs_config.yaml\\nCopy over the values from this file into langsmith_obs_config.yaml, making sure to modify the values to match your LangSmith deployment.\\nFind the latest version of the chart by running helm search repo langchain/langsmith-observability --versions.\\nGrab the latest version number, and run helm install langsmith-observability langchain/langsmith-observability --values langsmith_obs_config.yaml --version <version> -n <namespace> --wait --debug\\n\\nThis will allow you to scrape metrics at the following service endpoints:\\n\\nPostgres: langsmith-observability-postgres-exporter:9187/metrics\\nRedis: langsmith-observability-redis-exporter:9121/metrics\\nNginx: langsmith-observability-nginx-exporter:9113/metrics\\nKubeStateMetrics: langsmith-observability-kube-state-metrics:8080/metrics\\n\\nYou should see the following if the installation went through:\\nCopyRelease \"langsmith-observability\" has been installed.

Use this to gain quick insight into logs, metrics and traces for your deployment. This is only made to handle a few dozen GB of data per day.\\nThis section will show you how to deploy the end-to-end observability stack for LangSmith, using the Helm Chart.\\nThis chart is built around the open-source LGTM Stack from Grafana. It consists of:\\n\\nLoki for logs.\\nMimir for metrics + alerting.\\nTempo for traces.\\nGrafana for monitoring UI.\\n\\nAs well as OpenTelemetry Collectors for gathering the telemetry data.\\n\\u200bPrerequisites\\n\\u200b1. Compute Resources\\nThe resource requests and limits for each part of the stack can be modified in the helm chart. Here are the current allocations (request/limit):\\n\\nLoki: 2vCPU/3vCPU + 2Gi/4Gi\\nMimir: 1vCPU/2vCPU + 2Gi/4Gi\\nTempo: 1vCPU/2vCPU + 4Gi/6Gi\\n\\nMake sure you have those resources allocated before bringing up the helm chart, or modify the resource values in your helm configuration file.\\n\\u200b2. Cert-Manager\\nThe helm chart uses the OpenTelemetry Operator to provision collectors. The operator require that you have cert-manager installed in your Kubernetes cluster.\\nIf you do not have it installed, you can run the following commands:\\nCopyhelm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.iohelm repo updatehelm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager -n cert-manager --create-namespace\\n\\n\\u200b3. OpenTelemetry Operator\\nUse the following to install the OpenTelemetry Operator:\\nCopyhelm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-chartshelm repo updatehelm install opentelemetry-operator open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator -n <namespace>\\n\\n\\u200bInstallation\\nThe following instructions will bring up OTel collectors, the LGTM stack, Grafana and Prometheus exporters.\\n\\nCreate a local file called langsmith_obs_config.yaml\\nCopy over the values from this file into langsmith_obs_config.yaml, making sure to modify the values to match your LangSmith deployment.\\nFind the latest version of the chart by running helm search repo langchain/langsmith-observability --versions.\\nGrab the latest version number, and run helm install langsmith-observability langchain/langsmith-observability --values langsmith_obs_config.yaml --version <version> -n <namespace> --wait --debug\\n\\nYou can selectively collect logs, metrics or traces by modifying the boolean values under otelCollector in your config file. You can also selectively bring up each respective piece of the backend (Loki, Mimir, Tempo).\\nYou should see the following if the install went through:\\nCopyRelease \"langsmith-observability\" has been installed.

This guide will help you diagnose and resolve these issues.\\n\\u200bGetting helpful information\\nTo diagnose and resolve an issue, you will first need to retrieve some relevant information. Below, we explain how to do this for a kubernetes setup, a docker setup, as well as how to pull helpful browser info.\\nGenerally, the main services you will want to analyze are:\\n\\nlangsmith-backend: The main backend service.\\nlangsmith-platform-backend: Another important backend service.\\nlangsmith-queue: The queue service.\\n\\n\\u200bKubernetes\\nThe first step in troubleshooting is to gather important debugging information about your LangSmith deployment. Service logs, kubernetes events, and resource utilization of containers can help identify the root cause of an issue.\\nYou can run our k8s troubleshooting script which will pull all of the relevant kubernetes information and output it to a folder for investigation. The script also compresses this folder into a zip file for sharing. Here is an example of how to run this script, assuming your langsmith deployment was brought up in a langsmith namespace:\\nCopybash get_k8s_debugging_info.sh --namespace langsmith\\n\\nYou can then inspect the contents of the produced folder for any relevant errors or information. If you would like the LangSmith team to assist in debugging, please share this zip file with the team.\\n\\u200bDocker\\nIf running on Docker, you can check the logs your deployment by running the following command:\\nCopydocker compose logs >> logs.txt\\n\\n\\u200bBrowser Errors\\nIf you are experiencing an issue that surfaces as a browser error, it may also be helpful to inspect a HAR file which may include key information. To get the HAR file, you can follow this guide which explains the short process for various browsers.\\nYou can then use Google’s HAR analyzer to investigate. You can also send your HAR file to the LangSmith team to help with debugging.\\n\\u200bCommon issues\\n\\u200bDB::Exception: Cannot reserve 1.00 MiB, not enough space: While executing WaitForAsyncInsert. (NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE)\\nThis error occurs when ClickHouse runs out of disk space. You will need to increase the disk space available to ClickHouse.\\n\\u200bKubernetes\\nIn Kubernetes, you will need to increase the size of the ClickHouse PVC. To achieve this, you can perform the following steps:\\n\\n\\nGet the storage class of the PVC: kubectl get pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 -n <namespace> -o jsonpath=\\'{.spec.storageClassName}\\'\\n\\n\\nEnsure the storage class has AllowVolumeExpansion: true: kubectl get sc <storage-class-name> -o jsonpath=\\'{.allowVolumeExpansion}\\'\\n\\nIf it is false, some storage classes can be updated to allow volume expansion.\\nTo update the storage class, you can run kubectl patch sc <storage-class-name> -p \\'{\"allowVolumeExpansion\": true}\\'\\nIf this fails, you may need to create a new storage class with the correct settings.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit your pvc to have the new size: kubectl edit pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 -n <namespace> or kubectl patch pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 \\'{\"spec\":{\"resources\":{\"requests\":{\"storage\":\"100Gi\"}}}}\\' -n <namespace>\\n\\n\\nUpdate your helm chart langsmith_config.yaml to new size(e.g 100 Gi)\\n\\n\\nDelete the clickhouse statefulset kubectl delete statefulset langsmith-clickhouse --cascade=orphan -n <namespace>\\n\\n\\nApply helm chart with updated size (You can follow the upgrade guide here)\\n\\n\\nYour pvc should now have the new size. Verify by running kubectl get pvc and kubectl exec langsmith-clickhouse-0 -- bash -c \"df\"\\n\\n\\n\\u200bDocker\\nIn Docker, you will need to increase the size of the ClickHouse volume. To achieve this, you can perform the following steps:\\n\\nStop your instance of LangSmith. docker compose down\\nIf using bind mount, you will need to increase the size of the mount point.\\nIf using a docker volume, you will need to allocate more space to the volume/docker.\\n\\n\\u200berror: Dirty database version ‘version’. Fix and force version\\nThis error occurs when the ClickHouse database is in an inconsistent state with our migrations. You will need to reset to an earlier database version and then rerun your upgrade/migrations.\\n\\u200bKubernetes\\n\\nForce migration to an earlier version, where version = dirty version - 1.\\n\\nCopykubectl exec -it deployments/langsmith-backend -- bash -c \\'migrate -source \"file://clickhouse/migrations\" -database \"clickhouse://$CLICKHOUSE_HOST:$CLICKHOUSE_NATIVE_PORT?username=$CLICKHOUSE_USER&password=$CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD&database=$CLICKHOUSE_DB&x-multi-statement=true&x-migrations-table-engine=MergeTree&secure=$CLICKHOUSE_TLS\" force <version>\\'\\n\\n\\nRerun your upgrade/migrations.\\n\\n\\u200bDocker\\n\\nForce migration to an earlier version, where version = dirty version - 1.\\n\\nCopydocker compose exec langchain-backend migrate -source \"file://clickhouse/migrations\" -database \"clickhouse://$CLICKHOUSE_HOST:$CLICKHOUSE_NATIVE_PORT?username=$CLICKHOUSE_USER&password=$CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD&database=$CLICKHOUSE_DB&x-multi-statement=true&x-migrations-table-engine=MergeTree&secure=$CLICKHOUSE_TLS\" force <version>\\n\\n\\nRerun your upgrade/migrations.\\n\\n\\u200b413 - Request Entity Too Large\\nThis error occurs when the request size exceeds the maximum allowed size. You will need to increase the maximum request size in your Nginx configuration.\\n\\u200bKubernetes\\n\\nEdit your langsmith_config.yaml and increase the frontend.maxBodySize value. This might look something like this:\\n\\nCopyfrontend:\\n  maxBodySize: \"100M\"\\n\\n\\nApply your changes to the cluster.\\n\\n\\u200bDetails: code: 497, message: default: Not enough privileges. To execute this query, it’s necessary to have the grant CREATE ROW POLICY ON default.feedbacks_rmt\\nThis error occurs when your user does not have the necessary permissions to create row policies in Clickhouse. When deploying the Docker deployment, you need to copy the users.xml file from the github repo as well. This adds the <access_management> tag to the users.xml file, which allows the user to create row policies. Below is the default users.xml file that we expect to be used.\\nCopy<clickhouse>\\n    <users>\\n        <default>\\n            <access_management>1</access_management>\\n            <named_collection_control>1</named_collection_control>\\n            <show_named_collections>1</show_named_collections>\\n            <show_named_collections_secrets>1</show_named_collections_secrets>\\n            <profile>default</profile>\\n        </default>\\n    </users>\\n    <profiles>\\n        <default>\\n            <async_insert>1</async_insert>\\n            <async_insert_max_data_size>2000000</async_insert_max_data_size>\\n            <wait_for_async_insert>0</wait_for_async_insert>\\n            <parallel_view_processing>1</parallel_view_processing>\\n            <allow_simdjson>0</allow_simdjson>\\n            <lightweight_deletes_sync>0</lightweight_deletes_sync>\\n        </default>\\n    </profiles>\\n</clickhouse>\\n\\nIn some environments, your mount point may not be writable by the container. In these cases we suggest building a custom image with the users.xml file included.\\nExample Dockerfile:\\nCopyFROM clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.8\\nCOPY ./users.xml /etc/clickhouse-server/users.d/users.xml\\n\\nThen take the following steps:\\n\\nBuild your custom image.\\n\\nCopydocker build -t <image-name> .\\n\\n\\nUpdate your docker-compose.yaml to use the custom image. Make sure to remove the users.xml mount point.\\n\\nCopylangchain-clickhouse:\\n  image: <image-name>\\n\\n\\nRestart your instance of LangSmith.\\n\\nCopydocker compose down --volumes\\ndocker compose up\\n\\n\\u200bClickHouse fails to start up when running a cluster with AquaSec\\nIn some environments, AquaSec may prevent ClickHouse from starting up correctly. This may manifest as the ClickHouse pod not emitting any logs and failing to get marked as ready.\\nGenerally this is due to LD_PRELOAD being set by AquaSec, which interferes with ClickHouse.

If you have not, please refer to the kubernetes deployment guide or the docker deployment guide.\\n\\u200bConfiguring the application you want to use with LangSmith\\nLangSmith has a single API for interacting with both the hub and the LangSmith backend.\\n\\nOnce you have deployed your instance, you can access the LangSmith UI at http(s)://<host>.\\nThe LangSmith API will be available at http(s)://<host>/api/v1\\nThe LangGraph Platform Control Plane will be available at http(s)://<host>/api-host\\n\\nTo use the API of your instance, you will need to set the following environment variables in your application:\\nCopyLANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=http://<host>/api/v1\\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY=foo # Set to a legitimate API key if using OAuth\\n\\nYou can also configure these variables directly in the LangSmith SDK client:\\nCopyimport langsmith\\nlangsmith_client = langsmith.Client(\\n    api_key='<api_key>',\\n    api_url='http(s)://<host>/api/v1',\\n)\\n\\nAfter setting the above, you should be able to run your code and see the results in your self-hosted instance. We recommend running through the quickstart guide to get a feel for how to use LangSmith.\\n\\u200bSelf-Signed Certificates\\nIf you are using self-signed certificates for your self-hosted LangSmith instance, this can be problematic as Python comes with its own set of trusted certificates, which may not include your self-signed certificate. To resolve this, you may need to use something like truststore to load system certificates into your Python environment.\\nYou can do this like so:\\n\\npip install truststore (or similar depending on the package manager you are using)\\n\\nThen use the following code to load the system certificates:\\nCopyimport truststore\\ntruststore.inject_into_ssl()\\n# The rest of your code\\nimport langsmith\\nlangsmith_client = langsmith.Client(\\n    api_key='<api_key>',\\n    api_url='http(s)://<host>/api/v1',\\n)\\n\\n\\u200bAPI Reference\\nTo access the API reference, navigate to http://<host>/api/docs in your browser.Was this page helpful?YesNoSuggest editsInstall on DockerUpgrade an installation⌘IAssistantResponses are generated using AI and may contain mistakes.Docs by LangChain home pagegithubxlinkedinyoutubeResourcesChangelogLangChain AcademyTrust CenterCompanyAboutCareersBloggithubxlinkedinyoutubePowered by Mintlify\"),\n",
